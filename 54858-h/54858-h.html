        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This book is
        intended to be a literary and critical examination of the historical
        evidence for the Virgin Birth. It is not the writer's desire to
        discuss the evidence from the point of view of an advocate; with a
        view, that is to say, of obtaining an uncompromising verdict. His aim
        is rather to trace and to define the earliest Christian tradition
        upon the subject, and to show the limits and the bearings of the
        historical question.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A limited aim such
        as this ought not to require much justification. If, however,
        justification is needed, it is not far to seek.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much of the
        literature which treats of the Virgin Birth is controversial in point
        of origin if not in form, and, in the nature of the case, it could
        not have been otherwise. Controversial literature has, of course, a
        necessary place in the search for truth. Nevertheless, it is exposed
        to serious perils, especially when such a subject as that of the
        Virgin Birth is discussed. It is not always easy, for example, to
        avoid an arbitrary treatment of the New Testament, and to prevent
        philosophic or dogmatic presuppositions from determining purely
        critical questions. Few will deny that the discussion of the Virgin
        Birth has suffered in these directions, and that, as a consequence,
        the problem remains in considerable confusion. Not only has the
        evidence been variously estimated, but there are the widest
        differences of opinion as to what the evidence really is. Neither
        side has succeeded in convincing the other, and very many students of
        the question preserve an attitude of suspended judgement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The point which it
        is important to make is that, if any escape is to be made from the
        present impasse, the problem must be approached in another way.
        Doctrinal presuppositions must be resolutely laid aside; there must
        be a common desire to ascertain the true facts of the evidence,
        whatever the results may be. Not that dogmatic considerations have no
        place in the problem! It is part of the conclusion reached in this
        book that in the end <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg
        iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        dogmatic considerations do determine the issue. But it must be
        <span class="tei tei-q">“in the end”</span>; not at the beginning,
        nor in the middle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be that the
        writer has not himself escaped the perils to which he has referred.
        He can only say that no pains have been spared to achieve this
        purpose. It is true that the problem has been faced with a conviction
        that, while truly man, Jesus was much more than man as we know him to
        be. But this is not a presupposition which colours the evidence. On
        the contrary, it is the one point of view which recognizes that there
        is a problem to be solved. If our Lord was a prophet, and no more,
        there is no real difficulty; no one would defend the Virgin Birth
        upon such terms. The question becomes a living issue only when Jesus
        is believed to be more than man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Chapter I the
        New Testament evidence outside the First and Third Gospels is
        discussed. On the question of the attitude of the Fourth Evangelist
        to the Virgin Birth—a question as difficult as it is interesting—the
        writer has been glad to accept and to work out a striking suggestion
        made by Dr. E. F. Scott (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">The Fourth Gospel, its Purpose and
        Theology</span></span>).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One reason for
        allotting three chapters to the Third Gospel is the complexity of the
        Lukan problem. The theory which is outlined in Chapter IV is one
        which has not yet received sufficient consideration. The alternative,
        in the opinion of the writer, is to regard the Miraculous Conception
        as a <span class="tei tei-q">“necessary stone in the
        structure”</span> of Lk. i, ii. It is the difficulties mentioned in
        Chapter II which have prevented him from taking this view. The writer
        is convinced that St. Luke believed and taught the Virgin Birth.
        Nevertheless, the critical difficulties are such that it has not been
        found possible to accept this view in the form in which it is
        generally held.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is well to
        remember that he who states a theory in connexion with such problems
        contributes to their solution, whether his theory stands the test of
        time or not. Even in the case of failure the possibilities are
        reduced and a by-path is revealed as such. As an illustration of
        this, reference may be made to the view which ascribes the Virgin
        Birth tradition in Lk. i, ii to an unknown and later writer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One chapter
        (Chapter V) has been assigned to the First Gospel. The exposition
        there given is one which is widely held <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagev">[pg v]</span><a name="Pgv" id="Pgv" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> in this country, but an attempt has been made
        to emphasize the unique character of the Evangelist's standpoint,
        which, it is believed, is the key to the textual problem of Mt. i.
        16. The textual problem is treated in an Appendix to the chapter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may seem
        strange that in Chapter VI no decided opinion is expressed for or
        against the Virgin Birth. The justification for this position is the
        fact that, in the end, the question becomes one of Theology, and that
        to attack the theological problem would be to go beyond the limited
        aim which the present work has in view.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One result of the
        investigation is that the documentary evidence for the Virgin Birth
        is found to be earlier than <span class="tei tei-q">“negative”</span>
        criticism has allowed. But to accept this conclusion is only to be
        brought face to face with the question which the modern New Testament
        student cannot escape. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whence come the
        sources upon which the Evangelists drew?”</span> At first sight the
        problem seems hopeless. To recover and to describe with objectivity
        of statement the several sources which the Evangelists employed is a
        task beset with difficulties: to penetrate still further might well
        seem impossible. If, however, the problem is faced bravely, with an
        open mind and an eagerness to learn, it may be that as time passes
        there will be cause to rejoice over real progress made. The journey
        is not the plunge into the dark which it might be thought to be. If,
        indeed, it will bring men nearer to the Jesus of history, it is a
        quest which cannot be refused, however great the difficulties may
        be.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a subject such
        as this, certain things have necessarily to be taken for granted. The
        author of the First Gospel is regarded as unknown; accordingly, he is
        spoken of as the First Evangelist or as St. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Matthew”</span>. The writer of the Fourth Gospel is also
        referred to as the Fourth Evangelist, the question of authorship
        being left open. St. Mark and St. Luke, the companions of St. Paul,
        are assumed to be the authors of the Second and Third Gospels
        respectively; St. Luke is also believed to be the author of the Acts.
        The reader who does not accept these views may mentally substitute
        such phrases as the Second and Third Evangelists wherever St. Mark
        and St. Luke are mentioned. Such abbreviations as Mt., Mk., Lk., Jn.
        are always meant to refer to the Gospels, not to their
        authors.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg
        vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It only remains
        for the writer to express his deep sense of gratitude to those to
        whose knowledge and help he is debtor. How much he owes to earlier
        workers in the field will be sufficiently evident. It has proved by
        no means an easy task to weigh and to differentiate between opposing
        views, and the writer is not unmindful of his temerity, in certain
        places, in dissenting from opinions supported by justly honoured
        names.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He desires
        particularly to speak of the generous encouragement he received in
        his task from the late Dr. Sanday. Dr. Sanday had made a provisional
        promise to write a brief introduction to the present work. His
        lamented death has prevented the carrying out of this promise, and
        for the lack of such an introduction the book is so much the
        poorer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer further
        wishes to express his gratitude to his former tutor, the Rev. Prof.
        A. S. Geden, M.A., D.D., and to the Rev. J. Walthew Simister, for
        their kindness in reading the typescript, and in suggesting
        improvements, and also to the Rev. Prof. F. Bertram Clogg, M.A., for
        his valued assistance in the reading of the proof-sheets.</p>

        Testament Outside The First And Third Gospels</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Outside the First
        and Third Gospels there is no direct reference to the Virgin Birth in
        the New Testament. There are passages which have been said to imply a
        knowledge of the doctrine, but, for particularity of statement, none
        of them can be compared with Mt. i. 18-25 and Lk. i. 34 f. This fact
        must be our justification in the present chapter for treating
        together the New Testament Books outside these two Gospels.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inquiry is
        mainly a study in silence; it is for that reason both difficult and
        complicated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. Sanday has
        expressed considerable distrust in the argument from silence (cf.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
        Criticism, of the Fourth Gospel</span></span>, pp. 33-41). He quotes
        a striking passage from Dr. Drummond's <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Character and
        Authorship of the Fourth Gospel</span></span> (p. 157 f.), in which
        reference is made to Theophilus of Antioch, who, in a defence of
        Christianity, relates nothing about Christ Himself, and maintains a
        remarkable silence concerning the Gospels. The quotation ends with
        the words: <span class="tei tei-q">“We may learn from these curious
        facts that it is not correct to say that a writer knows nothing of
        certain things, simply because he had not occasion to refer to them
        in his only extant writing: or even because he does not mention them
        when his subject would seem naturally to lead him to do so.”</span>
        Dr. Sanday has two main objections to the way in which the argument
        from silence is often handled.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(1) The critic does not ask himself <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> is
        silent—what extent of material.... And (2) experience shows that the
        argument is often most fallacious”</span> (op. cit., p. 35).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing can be
        lost in considering this opinion at the outset of our inquiry. In the
        connexion in which it is urged, it has very great justification. Dr.
        Sanday is referring to the paucity of references to the Gospels in
        the second century previous to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> 170 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> The real question is,
        he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“What is the relation which the
        extant evidence bears to the whole body of that which once existed,
        and how far can we trust the inferences drawn from it?”</span> The
        available literature is confessedly small. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If we take the whole extant Christian literature between
        the years 130 and 170 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, it would not fill more
        than a thin octavo volume, and by far the greater part of that is
        taken up with external controversy”</span> (ib., p. 39).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The caution
        suggested by these words is distinctly healthy. It may be questioned,
        however, whether Dr. Sanday's point of view would apply quite so well
        as regards the alleged silence of so many New Testament Books with
        reference to the Virgin Birth. There are good reasons for this
        opinion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The existing
        New Testament Writings represent the best Christian literature of the
        period which they cover. No one would compare them in this respect
        with the extant works of the first seven decades of the second
        century.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) While not
        exhaustive in their treatment, the Gospels are faithful to the
        outstanding events in the life of Jesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) The Epistles
        are rich in doctrinal teaching. Occasional in point of origin, they
        impinge again and again upon the great doctrines of the Christian
        Faith. The Incarnation and the Person of Christ especially are
        central.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, then, very
        many New Testament Writings are found to be silent as regards the
        Virgin Birth, the silence is not one which can be ignored. It may in
        part be explained, but it must not be explained away. If it exists,
        it is not a silence which can be regarded with equanimity; it must be
        significant, and no pains can be spared in trying to understand that
        significance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We believe, then,
        that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">argumentum ex
        silentio</span></span> has a valid place in our inquiry. All the
        more, therefore, must we consider what the possibilities of silence
        are. Obviously, silence may be consistent with knowledge of a fact or
        lack of knowledge. But that is not all. If it implies knowledge, it
        may mean tacit acceptance of the fact, tacit rejection, or
        comparative indifference. Lack of knowledge, on the other hand, may
        be explained by special circumstances, or by the view that the
        alleged fact is untrue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In treating the
        New Testament Books outside the First and <span class="tei tei-pb"

        determine whether their silence is complete. Where this is the case,
        we have to try, so far as we can, to interpret the silence. Each
        stage is, however, a further step into the unknown, and must
        therefore be taken with increasing care and caution.</p>

          author of ten, if not thirteen, Epistles. Several passages have
          been quoted from his writings, in support of the view that the
          Virgin Birth tradition was known to him. Among these are Gal. iv.
          4, Rom. i. 3, and passages in which St. Paul speaks of Christ as
          the Second Adam, notably Rom. v. 12-15 and 1 Cor. xv. 47.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gal. iv. 4 f.
          reads as follows: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">But when the fulness of the time came, God
          sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, that he
          might redeem them which were under the law, that we might receive
          the adoption of sons</span></span>. It is most improbable that
          there is here any reference to the Virgin Birth, or even any
          indication that the doctrine is known to St. Paul. The phrase
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">born of a woman</span></span>”</span> is one
          that is used naturally of an ordinary human birth (cf. Job xiv. 1;
          and Mt. xi. 11 (Lk. vii. 28) <span class="tei tei-q">“among them
          that are born of women”</span>). The determining consideration is,
          however, the argument of Gal. iv. 1-7. St. Paul is there working
          out the figure of the heir who is yet a minor (verses 1, 2). While
          we were children, he argues, we were in bondage (verse 3). But,
          when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son to redeem
          men from the law. To accomplish this purpose, the Son must needs
          make Himself one with those He came to deliver. Like them He must
          be <span class="tei tei-q">“born under the law”</span>; like them
          He must be <span class="tei tei-q">“born of a woman”</span>. The
          one clause asserts His position as a child of the Jewish race; the
          other declares the reality of His humanity. There is not the
          slightest suggestion of a miraculous birth.<a id="noteref_1" name=
          "noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> Indeed,
          the more natural impression <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> made by the words is that of a birth common
          to all the sons of men. If St. Paul had wished to avoid giving that
          impression, he could have done so with ease, since he was perfectly
          familiar with the distinction between γυνή (woman) and παρθένος
          (virgin) (cf. 1 Cor. vii. 34).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rom. i. 3 f.
          reads: <span class="tei tei-q">“... <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his Son, who was born
          of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was declared to be
          the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by
          the resurrection of the dead</span></span>.”</span> Here the
          thought of the Virgin Birth is said to lie implicit in the opening
          words of the passage (cf. Orr, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Virgin Birth of
          Christ</span></span>, pp. 119 ff.; also Knowling, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Testimony of St. Paul
          to Christ</span></span>, p. 313; and Sweet, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Birth and Infancy
          of Jesus Christ</span></span>, p. 237 n.). Again, the exegesis
          cannot be allowed. St. Paul's words state an antithesis; they speak
          of the Son from two standpoints, that of the body and that of the
          spirit (SH., Rom., p. 7). <span class="tei tei-q">“According to the
          flesh”</span>, He was <span class="tei tei-q">“born (γενομένον) of
          the seed of David”</span>, but, <span class="tei tei-q">“according
          to the spirit of holiness”</span>, He was designated (ὁρισθέντος)
          Son of God <span class="tei tei-q">“by the resurrection of the
          dead”</span>. It is very difficult to think that the antithesis
          would have been stated in this way, if the Apostle had been
          thinking of the Virgin Birth. <span class="tei tei-q">“Born of the
          seed of David”</span> contains no reference to the doctrine. The
          Divine Sonship, indeed, is not mentioned until the following
          clause, and there it is said to be predicated, not in the Virgin
          Birth, but in the Resurrection. Without pressing the view that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“according to the flesh born of the seed of
          David”</span> implies an ordinary human birth, we may certainly
          claim that the Miraculous Conception is a thought entirely foreign
          to the passage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A further
          implication of the doctrine has been found in St. Paul's thought of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          Second Adam</span></span> (Rom. v. 12-21, 1 Cor. <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> xv. 44-9). In <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dissertations</span></span> (new ed., p. 11),
          Dr. Gore writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“What we can maintain,
          with great boldness, is that St. Paul's conception of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Second Adam’</span> postulates His
          miraculous birth”</span> (cf. Box, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Virgin Birth of
          Jesus</span></span>, p. 150). In a question of this kind, we must
          distinguish between what the doctrine of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Second Adam”</span> may or may not <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“postulate”</span> in our own minds, and what St.
          Paul's thoughts may have been. Certainly he gives us no reason to
          suppose that the Virgin Birth was in the background of his mind
          when he wrote Rom. v. 12-21.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2"
          href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> There
          would be as much justification, if not more, for the contrary
          suggestion. So far as 1 Cor. xv. 44-9 is concerned—(verse 47 reads:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">The second man is of
          heaven</span></span>”</span>)—the reference is to the Resurrection,
          not the Incarnation.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
          "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">None of these
          passages is sufficient to show that St. Paul was acquainted with
          the Virgin Birth tradition, nor can any others be cited. This fact
          is the more remarkable when we call to mind the great Pauline
          passages which bear upon the Incarnation. With the closest
          scrutiny, not one of them gives us reason to think that the Apostle
          knew of the Virgin Birth. This is true of the great Christological
          passage of Phil. ii. 5-11, and also of the well-known words of 2
          Cor. viii. 9. Most significant in this connexion are Phil. ii. 7
          (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Being made in the likeness of
          man</span></span>”</span>) and Rom. viii. 3 (which speaks of the
          Son as sent <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in the likeness of
          sinful flesh</span></span>”</span>). These passages are important
          because they clearly imply a difference between the humanity of
          Christ and ordinary humanity. This difference—indicated by the word
          <span class="tei tei-q">“likeness”</span> (ὁμοίωμα)—is certainly
          not a difference in mode of origin. Its character is manifest in
          Rom. viii. 3; it lies in the sinlessness and moral perfection of
          Jesus.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href=
          "#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> There
          is no indication that the Apostle is thinking of anything further,
          and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg
          006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          same is true of Phil. ii. 7. Viewing the passages as a whole, we
          must conclude that, not only is St. Paul completely silent as to
          the Virgin Birth, but that he is silent just where his silence is
          most difficult to understand, if he knew of the tradition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Can we go
          further, and say that St. Paul did not know of the doctrine? Short
          of a hard and fast conclusion, we are at liberty to state what
          would seem to be the probabilities of the case; and as regards
          these we can have little hesitation. It is reasonable to urge that
          St. Paul would have phrased his references to the Incarnation
          somewhat differently, if he had known of the Virgin Birth, and
          that, on the whole, his words are best explained by presuming his
          ignorance of the tradition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">W. C. Allen has
          suggested that St. Paul's silence may have been due to reasons of
          prudence. He may have thought that the tradition would prove
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a great stumbling-block to the progress of
          Christianity, and a continual source of wounded feeling for the
          reverence of Christians for the Person of their Master”</span>
          (ICC., St. Mt., p. 20). It is possible that this argument might go
          some way to explain the absence of direct allusions to the Virgin
          Birth in St. Paul's writings. It might cover his failure to employ
          the tradition as <span class="tei tei-q">“an argument for
          Christianity in his preaching to the Gentiles”</span>. But,
          assuredly, the theory is stretched to breaking-point, if it is made
          to cover the absence of the slightest indication that the doctrine
          was present to St. Paul's mind. For the most part, St. Paul's
          Epistles were not public manifestoes, but private letters, written
          to Christian communities. Moreover, they are intensely
          self-revealing. They permit us to appreciate how much St. Paul knew
          of the words and deeds of Jesus, and of the events of His earthly
          life. That they reveal no knowledge of the Virgin Birth is hardly
          to be explained by a policy of silence. Unless, on other grounds,
          it can be shown that the tradition was known in Apostolic circles
          during St. Paul's lifetime, his silence must be interpreted to mean
          lack of knowledge concerning it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This conclusion,
          if established, would not, of course, be fatal to the historical
          value of the Virgin Birth tradition. Special reasons might be
          forthcoming to account for the later spread of the belief. The
          importance of St. Paul's silence is that it furnishes help in
          deciding when the belief became current.</p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A further
          inference, of considerable theological importance, is that the
          Apostle could build up a mature and consistent Christology, without
          any reference to, and apparently, thought of the Miraculous
          Conception.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“source”</span>) is the symbol used to
          denote the main documentary source, upon which the First and Third
          Evangelists drew, in addition to St. Mark's Gospel. As regards its
          character, there is difference of opinion. Some scholars identify
          it with the Matthaean Logia of which Papias speaks; others regard
          the latter as an independent collection of Messianic proof-texts.
          By some it is thought to have been a Gospel; by others it is looked
          upon as a collection of the Sayings of Jesus, with a certain
          element of narrative. Wellhausen dates it later than Mk., but most
          scholars think that it is earlier, and date it from the sixties and
          in some cases from the fifties.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
          Virgin Birth, it is almost certain that Q did not contain the
          tradition. Harnack thinks that Q's narrative of the Baptism, with
          its use of Ps. ii. 7, <span class="tei tei-q">“excludes all ideas
          of pre-existence and miraculous birth”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sayings of
          Jesus</span></span>, p. 235), and J. M. Thompson, who quotes this
          opinion, finds in the Baptist's question, <span class=

          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Miracles</span></span>, p. 140). What is more
          important than either of these arguments, is the fact that neither
          the First nor the Third Evangelist drew a Virgin Birth tradition
          from Q. The presumption is that Q was silent as regards the Virgin
          Birth,<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">St.
          Mark's Gospel</span></span>, our first task is to ask if its
          silence is complete. This leads at once to a discussion of Mk. vi.
          3: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parentage among
          the Jews was traced on the father's side. The passage may therefore
          imply that Joseph was already dead. Archdeacon Allen thinks that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“son of Mary”</span> is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“more naturally an allusion to the supernatural
          circumstances of the birth of Jesus”</span> (ICC., St. Mt., p.

          going so far as this, Canon Box thinks that there is something
          <span class="tei tei-q">“decidedly remarkable and unusual”</span>
          in the phrase, and suggests that it is probably contemptuous (op.
          cit., p. 139).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However we
          explain the phrase, we ought not to interpret Mk. vi. 3 as implying
          a knowledge of the Virgin Birth on the part of the people of
          Nazareth. Mt. xiii. 55 and Lk. iv. 22 directly exclude this
          view.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But did the
          Evangelist know of the Virgin Birth? Has a knowledge of the
          doctrine shaped his phrasing in Mk. vi. 3? The question is
          complicated by critical considerations. It is suggested by several
          scholars that the passage, in whole or in part, is a later addition
          to the Second Gospel.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=

          is much to be said for this view, but, so far as our immediate
          purpose is concerned, we have no need to discuss it in detail. On
          either view—that of the critical theory just mentioned, or that
          which attributes the passage to the Evangelist—it is improbable
          that St. Mark intended to refer to the Virgin Birth, or was
          influenced by the doctrine. On the interpolation-hypothesis, this
          is obvious enough, but it is also true if Mk. vi. 3 is original.

          breathes in the words, have great force. We may also note that the
          passage goes on to refer to the brothers and sisters of Jesus, with
          no suggestion that the relationship was other than full and
          complete. But what is most telling of all is the fact that, if Mk.
          vi. 3 does imply St. Mark's knowledge of the Virgin Birth, both St.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Matthew”</span> and St. Luke, in their own
          narratives, have destroyed the reference. This is all the more
          remarkable if the First Evangelist's treatment of Mk. vi. 3 is
          motived by reverence for the Person of Jesus.<a id="noteref_12"
          name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>
          Finally, can we suppose that St. Mark would have placed his sole
          reference to the Virgin Birth in the lips of unbelieving Jews who
          speak with thinly veiled contempt? For these reasons, we find it
          impossible to discover in Mk. vi. 3 a reference to the Virgin Birth
          by St. Mark; the Evangelist's silence is unbroken.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was, then, the
          tradition unknown to St. Mark?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Several passages
          have been cited in support of the contention that St. Mark had no
          knowledge of the doctrine. Among these is Mk. iii. 21, 31-5 (cf.
          Mt. xii. 46-50; Lk. viii. 19-21). The story of Mk. iii. 31-5 is
          that of the coming of Mary and of the brothers of Jesus, while our
          Lord is surrounded by a crowd, apparently in a house. When Jesus is
          informed that they are without seeking Him, He says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Who is my mother and my brethren?”</span>, and looking
          round upon the assembled company, He continues, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold, my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall
          do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and
          mother”</span>. The account in Mt. is almost identical, and St.
          Luke's story, while much briefer, is substantially the same. But
          St. Mark's narrative must be read in the light of Mk. iii. 21 (cf.
          Gould, ICC., St. Mk., pp. 61, 67)—a passage which is omitted in Mt.
          and in Lk. There, we are told that the friends of Jesus (οἱ παρ᾽
          αὐτοῦ, probably <span class="tei tei-q">“His kinsmen”</span>) went
          out to lay hold on Him, in the belief that He was mad. This fact
          must unquestionably be held to explain the action of the family of
          Jesus in the incident of Mk. iii. 31-5, and the question arises,
          Did Mary share in the fears and intentions of the rest?<a id=
          "noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A second passage
          is Mk. vi. 4, where Jesus declares that a prophet is not without
          honour, save in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his
          own house. The phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">among his own
          kin</span></span>”</span>, which both Mt. (xiii. 57) and Lk. (iv.
          24) omit, is said to point in the same direction as Mk. iii. 21,
          31-5.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href=
          "#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> A
          third incident adduced is that recorded in Mk. xii. 35-7 (Mt. xxii.
          41-6; Lk. xx. 41-4), where Jesus raises the question, how the
          Messiah can be at once David's Son and David's Lord. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Here again”</span>, writes Mr. Thompson, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Jesus assumes the reality of that human parentage on
          which His Davidic descent relies.... Thus it appears that on three
          separate occasions (and there are no others) when Jesus, according
          to the earliest Gospel, spoke about His birth, He used language
          naturally compatible with human parentage, and not naturally
          compatible with anything else”</span> (op. cit., p. 138).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen
          that these passages raise more than the question whether St. Mark
          knew of the Virgin Birth. They raise the question of the knowledge
          of Jesus, and indeed the whole question of the historical character
          of the Miraculous Conception.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Clearly, the
          question of the knowledge of Jesus is a determinative
          consideration. Few indeed will care to argue for the Virgin Birth
          tradition, if it can be proved that Jesus knew nothing of it, but
          believed Himself to be the son of Joseph. Just for this very reason
          we ought to be scrupulously careful in treating the question. A
          scientific inquiry will hesitate to draw an inference which makes
          further research superfluous. And in the present case hesitation is
          amply justified. We cannot share Mr. Thompson's conviction that the
          words of Jesus acknowledge a natural parentage. (1) Such exegesis
          must suffer an obvious discount if we find that the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Evangelist</span></em> knew nothing of the
          Virgin Birth. (2) We cannot be certain that Mary shared the fears
          and intentions of her children. (3) We do not know the tone in
          which Jesus spoke, nor can we be sure that He intended to repudiate
          His family. It may be so; but our opinion on these matters
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name=
          "Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> must rest upon what
          we believe about the Virgin Birth; the evidence is too uncertain to
          reverse the process.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
          Evangelist, we may say at once that we could account much more
          easily for the passages cited, if St. Mark did not know of the
          doctrine. But it is doubtful if we can say more, so long as we
          confine ourselves to what St. Mark has actually written.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is little
          difficulty in the third passage (Mk. xii. 35-7), since both Mt. and
          Lk. repeat it without material variation. Nor is there the force
          claimed in the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“among his own
          kin”</span> (Mk. vi. 4). In any case Mt. has the words <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in his own house”</span>, and probably the omission of
          the former phrase is sufficiently explained by the writer's
          tendency to remove redundant expressions in Mk.<a id="noteref_15"
          name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> While
          in the case of St. Luke, we have to remember that abbreviation is a
          common feature in his use of Markan material.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The real
          difficulty lies in Mk. iii. 21, 31-5. Something more than a desire
          for brevity must account for the later Evangelists' treatment of
          this story. Mary's position and attitude are certainly left very
          ambiguous in the light of Mk. iii. 21. In the subsequent story St.
          Mark does not distinguish her from the rest (iii. 31-5). In short,
          he leaves her open to the charge of having thought her Son
          distraught and in need of restraint. Ought we to find in this proof
          that St. Mark had no knowledge of the Virgin Birth? Our hesitation
          in drawing this conclusion arises out of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“objectivity”</span> of St. Mark's writing. Frequently,
          he does not hesitate to introduce details, to which, for various
          reasons, St. <span class="tei tei-q">“Matthew”</span> and St. Luke
          took exception. He does not appear to feel the difficulties which
          the later writers felt. We could not, therefore, attach the same
          significance to an <span class="tei tei-q">“inconsistency”</span>
          in Mk., as in Lk., or in Mt. For this reason, we think that, while
          Mk. iii. 21, 31-5 raises very great difficulties, the passage is
          not sufficient in itself to prove that St. Mark knew nothing of the
          Virgin Birth. We may say that the passage points in this direction,
          but that the inference requires further confirmation. Can this be
          found? We believe that it can be found in the broad fact of St.
          Mark's silence.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg
          012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is much
          greater significance in St. Mark's silence than is sometimes
          allowed. Why should he, as an Evangelist, remain silent about the
          Virgin Birth, if he knew of it, and believed in it? The deep
          interest which he takes in the descent of the Spirit at the
          Baptism, and his evident intention to describe this event as a
          crucial moment in the life of Jesus, set up a strong presumption
          that, had he known of the Miraculous Conception, he would have
          introduced it into his narrative. There is no sufficient analogy in
          his silence about other events in the life of Jesus which later
          writers record; no omission can be compared with this. Nor will
          reasons of prudence account for his silence; the Second Gospel is
          probably too late for this argument to have weight. There is still
          less force in the suggestion that St. Mark's intention was to
          describe only the public ministry of Jesus. This solution evades
          the difficulty, and comes perilously near to saying that St. Mark
          does not record the Virgin Birth tradition because he does not
          record it! The Second Gospel describes not only the death and
          burial of Jesus, but also the visit of the women to the tomb, and
          probably, in its original ending, some of the Post-Resurrection
          Appearances of Jesus. These facts are enough to show how inadequate
          it would be to describe the Gospel as an account of the public
          ministry of Jesus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having regard to
          all the facts of the case, the probability is that St. Mark's
          silence must be explained on the ground that the Evangelist had no
          knowledge of the Virgin Birth tradition. The further implication is
          that it formed no part of Apostolic preaching, and was unknown in
          the circles in which St. Mark moved. These conclusions cannot, of
          course, be hardened into certainties; they move in the realms of
          what is probable. Instead of being capable of refuting other
          considerations which might arise, they themselves require further
          confirmation.</p>

          not only by the silence of Acts, but also by the character of its
          Christology.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christ is spoken
          of as Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God by mighty works and
          wonders and signs (ii. 22), and as one who was anointed by God with
          the Holy Spirit, and with power, who went about doing good (x. 38).
          He is the Holy and Righteous One (iii. 14), the Prince of Life
          (iii. 15), whom God made both Lord and Christ (ii. 36). He is
          exalted to the right hand of God, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for
          to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins (v. 31).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all this, the
          main ground of appeal is to the Resurrection (ii. 24, 32, iii. 15,

          where the Davidic descent is mentioned (ii. 25 f., xiii. 23, 33),
          there is no suggestion other than that of direct physical lineage
          (<span class="tei tei-q">“Of this man's seed hath God according to
          promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus”</span>, xiii.
          23).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Does the silence
          of Acts permit us to draw any inferences concerning St. Luke's
          knowledge of the Virgin Birth tradition? The question ought to be
          considered apart altogether from Lk. i, ii. Having regard to the
          character of the work we do not think that any one conclusion can
          safely be drawn. The Acts obviously differs from the Gospels, and
          we cannot, as in the case of the Pauline Epistles, look to it for
          any sufficient account of the writer's Christology. It would
          therefore be unsafe to say that the silence of Acts implies that
          its author had no knowledge of the Virgin Birth.<a id="noteref_19"
          name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> If the
          doctrine was not a subject of Apostolic preaching, St. Luke must
          have known this: his silence may therefore be due to a sound
          historical sense. If, at the time when he wrote the Acts, his
          knowledge of the tradition had not long been gained, he would be
          still less likely to perpetrate what would have been an historical
          anachronism. On the other hand, we cannot, on the evidence of the
          Acts <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name=
          "Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> alone, show that he
          did know of the doctrine, and that the possibilities just stated
          represent the facts. The case is one in which the <span lang="la"

          untrustworthy in either direction. It should be emphasized that
          this view springs entirely out of the character of the book, and in
          no way affects the use of the argument we have made in the case of
          Mk. and the Epistles of St. Paul.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Epistle to
          the Hebrews</span></span> claims attention because of the developed
          character of its doctrine of the Person of Christ, and because its
          writer, while not an eye-witness (ii. 3), has a vivid knowledge of
          many events in the earthly life of Jesus. As regards the Virgin
          Birth, the Epistle is completely silent. In the comparison with
          Melchizedek (vii. 1-3), no stress can be laid on the fact that the
          latter is described as <span class="tei tei-q">“without
          father”</span>; he is also <span class="tei tei-q">“without
          mother”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“without
          genealogy”</span>. The reference to the descent of Jesus from the
          tribe of Judah (vii. 14) is left quite bare. Even the statements
          concerning the sinlessness of Christ (iv. 15, vii. 26), and the
          lofty characterization of the Son as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          effulgence”</span> of God's glory and <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          very impress of his substance”</span> (i. 3), are made without a
          word as to the method of the Incarnation. It is difficult to read
          the Epistle without feeling that the writer's thought is nowhere
          influenced by the Virgin Birth. Especially is this the case in such
          passages as ii. 14 (<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=

          Two considerations forbid, however, the drawing of this conclusion.
          We have no certain knowledge of the writer's identity, and we have

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What the
          writer's silence means is one of the most difficult problems in the
          question of the Virgin Birth. The case is different from any we
          have yet considered. For the doctrine of the Virgin Birth must have
          been perfectly well known to the Fourth Evangelist. He was well
          acquainted with the Synoptic Gospels,<a id="noteref_24" name=
          "noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> and
          there can be little doubt but that he read Lk. i, ii, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and Mt. i, ii, in the form in which we
          have them to-day. That he knew of the tradition is further
          confirmed by the fact that, so early probably as <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c.</span></span> 110
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, the Epistles of
          Ignatius contain several references to the doctrine (Eph. xviii. 2;
          xix. 1; Magn. 11; Tr. ix). The difficulty is further increased by
          the freedom with which the Evangelist treats the Synoptics.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“On the one hand their contents are very
          largely assumed; and on the other hand the author does not
          hesitate, where he thinks it necessary, to correct them.... The
          author evidently felt himself at liberty to select just those
          incidents which suited his purpose”</span> (Sanday, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Criticism of the
          Fourth Gospel</span></span>, p. 71).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the problem
          is usually treated, the silence of the Fourth Gospel is said to
          mean either <span class="tei tei-q">“tacit rejection”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“tacit acceptance”</span> of the tradition.
          It may be questioned, however, if these alternatives sufficiently
          cover the possibilities of the case. <span class="tei tei-q">“Tacit
          rejection”</span> under any circumstances means repudiation of the
          doctrine. But <span class="tei tei-q">“tacit acceptance”</span> may
          mean anything from comparative indifference to whole-hearted
          assent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As containing
          the sharper issue, the case for <span class="tei tei-q">“tacit
          rejection”</span> may be considered first. Among the arguments in
          favour of this view, we may note the following:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) Certain
          passages seem to require this position. In i. 45 Jesus is described
          by Philip as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the son of
          Joseph</span></span>”</span>, and in vi. 42 the Jews at Capernaum
          ask the question: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Is not this Jesus,
          the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we
          know?</span></span>”</span> Three times, moreover, controversy
          turns on the question of the birthplace of Jesus. The Jews look for
          the birthplace of the Messiah at Bethlehem (<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of
          the seed of David, and from Bethlehem?”</span>, vii. 42), or they
          regard it as unknown (<span class="tei tei-q">“When the Christ
          cometh, no one knoweth whence he is”</span>, vii. 27), and the
          objection is raised that Jesus is of Galilee (i. 45, vii. 41 f.,
          52). Nowhere does the Evangelist expose the futility of the
          controversy by a reference to Bethlehem as the birthplace of Jesus.
          On the contrary (it is said), he himself believed Nazareth to be
          the birthplace, and must thus have rejected the tradition of Mt. i,
          ii.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) Instead of
          directly repudiating a particular Synoptic narrative, the Fourth
          Evangelist's method is silently to set it aside by preferring
          another tradition or view. Is not his <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> preference for his own Incarnation theory a
          tacit repudiation of the Virgin Birth tradition?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of these
          arguments the second can be allowed only if we can show that the
          Evangelist looked upon the two doctrines, that of the Virgin Birth
          and that of the Incarnation of the Divine Logos, as contradictory
          and mutually exclusive. It is not possible, however, to prove this,
          and to assume it is to beg the question. The stronger argument is
          the first. It is certainly difficult to show that the language of
          i. 45 and vi. 42 is that of Philip and the Jews respectively, and
          that it does not reflect the Evangelist's point of view. In the
          Fourth Gospel we are often unable to assume that the writer intends
          to give the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">ipsissima verba</span></span>
          of those who speak. Are i. 45 and vi. 42 cases in point, or are
          they exceptions? The question is not an easy one to decide, unless,
          of course, we have satisfied ourselves that the Fourth Gospel is an
          entirely unhistorical work. In this case, i. 45 and vi. 42 will
          represent the Evangelist's opinions. But, on this view, we have
          largely forfeited our right to appeal to the Fourth Gospel in
          treating the question of the Virgin Birth on its historical side.
          We cannot have it both ways. If the Fourth Gospel shows a
          pronounced disregard of history, it is not permissible to draw
          historical arguments from it. It will have (on this view) an
          important bearing on the historical question from the theological
          side; but, as a primary historical authority, it must disappear.
          If, on the other hand, we admit—as we have good reason to admit—the
          presence of a considerable element of valuable historical tradition
          in the Fourth Gospel, it is by no means certain that i. 45 and vi.
          42 represent the Evangelist's views. As in the case of Mt. xiii. 55
          and Lk. iv. 22, these passages may indicate contemporary opinions
          and no more. This view is less easy to hold in the case of i. 45
          and vi. 42 than it is in respect of the Synoptic passages; but it
          is a possibility not lightly to be set aside. And if this is so, we
          cannot with confidence urge that in i. 45 and vi. 42 the Fourth
          Evangelist repudiates the Virgin Birth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
          passages which connect Jesus with Nazareth and Galilee, it is not
          necessary to infer that the writer looked upon the town as the
          birthplace of our Lord. His silence regarding Bethlehem is strange,
          but it does not compel us to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> conclude that he is rejecting the tradition
          bound up with Mt. i, ii, as Mr. Thompson thinks (op. cit., p.
          158).<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href=
          "#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> The
          more important fact is that the Evangelist does not name <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any
          town</span></em>, not even Nazareth, as the birthplace of the
          Eternal Word.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The view that
          the Fourth Evangelist tacitly rejects the Virgin Birth fails to
          justify itself on internal grounds. It is also opposed by
          considerations of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">external</span></em> character. It is from the
          locality in which probably the Fourth Gospel arose, that we have
          the earliest references to the Virgin Birth outside the New
          Testament. Ignatius, according to Dr. Moffatt (INT., p. 211), seems
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to fuse the Johannine idea of the
          incarnation with the synoptic birth-stories”</span>. If this is so,
          the fact does not compel us to suppose that the Fourth Evangelist
          would have done the same; but it raises a strong presumption
          against the view that he explicitly rejected the tradition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Must we then
          suppose that the Evangelist's silence means <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“tacit acceptance”</span> of the doctrine? Obviously,
          the failure to prove <span class="tei tei-q">“tacit
          rejection”</span> tells so far in the opposite direction. But, as
          we have seen, <span class="tei tei-q">“tacit acceptance”</span> is
          a very elastic term; it calls, therefore, for closer
          consideration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It can scarcely
          be shown that the Fourth Evangelist accepts the Virgin Birth in the
          same way in which it is held in Mt. i, ii. There is no sufficient
          answer to this assertion in the plea that the story had been
          already told, and that the Evangelist's purpose was to supplement
          the Synoptic narratives. This is a view of the Fourth Gospel which
          cannot be carried through. It is better to suppose that the
          Evangelist's omission of the Virgin Birth tradition has a more
          definite meaning, even though we reject the view that its
          significance is silent repudiation of the doctrine. We have also to
          find a place in our solution of the problem for the difficulties
          left over in i. 45 and vi. 42, and in the Evangelist's failure to
          name the birthplace of Jesus. In other words, arguments
          insufficient to prove <span class="tei tei-q">“tacit
          rejection”</span> cannot on that account be ignored. They must
          rather be held to condition the sense in which we speak of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“tacit acceptance”</span>.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Evangelist's
          silence regarding the Virgin Birth can only be understood when it
          is considered along with his other notable <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“omissions”</span>. It is one of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“a whole series of episodes, cardinal to the Synoptic
          story”</span> (Scott, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Fourth Gospel</span></span>, p. 42). This
          series includes the Genealogy, the Virgin Birth, the Baptism, the
          Temptation, the Transfiguration, the Supper, the Agony, the
          Ascension. The true explanation is probably that given by Dr. E. F.
          Scott: <span class="tei tei-q">“These remarkable omissions ...
          cannot be due to oversight or to the leaving out of what was
          non-essential. Without doubt they have been made deliberately, in
          view of certain theories and presuppositions with which the writer
          approached his subject”</span> (ib., p. 42 f.). These words set us
          on the right track. The Evangelist's silence does not mean that he
          rejected the Virgin Birth tradition. The Synoptic birth-stories
          were more probably accepted by him <span class="tei tei-q">“as a
          part of the orthodox tradition, in which, as a member of the
          Church, he acquiesced”</span> (ib., p. 188). His doctrinal
          sympathies, however, lay in another direction. It may be that at
          the time when he first heard of the Virgin Birth tradition, his
          doctrine of the Incarnate Word had already shaped itself in his
          mind. Jesus Christ was the Eternal Son of God, the Word made flesh,
          who became incarnate by His own voluntary act. The fact that his
          own theological scheme was already developed, together with its
          specific character,<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href=
          "#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> may
          well account for his neglect of the Virgin Birth. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He does not deny the
          story, but his own Christology has superior spiritual
          attractions.</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen
          that this theory leaves little room for difficulties arising from
          such passages as i. 45 and vi. 42, and explains at once the
          Evangelist's attitude to the question of the birthplace of Jesus.
          On the one hand, the doctrinal presuppositions of the Virgin Birth
          were not operative in his mind; on the other hand, in the light of
          his doctrine of the Logos, the difficulties mentioned would
          scarcely be felt. The Jewish controversies must have seemed to him
          so much playing with words. What did it matter <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> where the Word became flesh? What did
          it matter if men called Him Joseph's son?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our conclusion,
          then, is that the Fourth Evangelist tacitly accepts the Virgin
          Birth, but gives it no place in his doctrinal system. With the
          theological significance of this result we are not now concerned.
          Our present interest is rather in its historical implications. On
          the positive side, it yields little; on the negative side, its
          importance is greater. It is not permissible to argue against the
          Virgin Birth tradition on the ground that the Fourth Evangelist
          rejected it. We may go further and say that, having regard to his
          evident preoccupation with the Logos-doctrine, it may not even be
          safe to make too much of the fact that he ignored the
          tradition.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">Chapter II. The Virgin Birth And The
        Third Gospel</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question to be
        discussed in this chapter needs careful definition. What we wish to
        discover, if possible, is whether the Virgin Birth is an original
        element in the Third Gospel. This question is not without a certain
        ambiguity. It is sometimes taken as if it were equivalent to the
        further question, Did St. Luke teach the Virgin Birth? It is clear
        that these questions are closely connected; nevertheless, they are
        distinct, and should be kept distinct. The difference is at once
        apparent if, for purposes of argument, we assume that the doctrine
        really does belong to a later stratum in the Gospel. In this case,
        all the references to the tradition must have been inserted, either
        (i) by an unknown reader, editor, or scribe, or (ii) by St. Luke
        himself. In either case, the Virgin Birth would be a later element in
        the Gospel; but the two senses in which this could be true are
        clearly very different.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before one could
        say that St. Luke did not teach the Virgin Birth, it would be
        necessary to show that he did not write the passage Lk. i. 34
        f.,<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> and this
        is a point which cannot be determined by arguments derived from the
        context and subject-matter alone. Such arguments may, or may not, be
        able to prove that the doctrine is a later element, but they cannot
        show that it is a non-Lukan element. This is a second and distinct
        step, which is not justified until the textual and the linguistic
        facts have been examined. Then, and then only, can we say if St. Luke
        taught the Virgin Birth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the present
        chapter all questions of a linguistic character will be left aside.
        Lk. i. 34 f. is perfectly susceptible of the linguistic test, and
        this will be applied in its proper place. The only arguments we shall
        consider at present will be those which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> arise out of matters of context and
        subject-matter. In the light, then, of the principle laid down above,
        the question whether St. Luke taught the Virgin Birth, does not yet
        properly arise. The only question we have to consider at this stage
        is whether the Virgin Birth is an original element in the Third
        Gospel, interpreting that question in its strictest and barest
        sense.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The distinction we
        have drawn is perfectly obvious when it is pointed out. At the same
        time, one cannot read the literature which treats of the Third Gospel
        in relation to the Virgin Birth, without feeling how frequently the
        point has been neglected. The assumption, that, if the Virgin Birth
        is found to be a later element in the Gospel, we must straightway
        have recourse to the hypothesis of non-Lukan interpolation, runs
        through the writings of critics of all schools like a refrain. Its
        presence in the arguments of those who deny the Virgin Birth is often
        sufficiently clear. But the same assumption is also tacitly made by
        many critics on the other side. It would be ungenerous, and perhaps
        unwarranted, to suggest that this assumption has prevented many
        orthodox writers from doing justice to the objections which have been
        raised against the view that the doctrine was present in the Gospel
        from the very first. That its effects have been harmful in the
        interests of dispassionate investigation, is, however, hardly open to
        question. In the treatment which follows, an attempt will be made to
        avoid this fallacy, and to keep the discussion within the limits
        which are proper to itself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The material to be
        examined is found for the most part in the first two chapters of the
        Gospel, and consists (1) of certain narratives and passages, which
        apparently are inconsistent with the view that the author wrote with
        a knowledge of the Virgin Birth, and (2) of the passage i. 34 f.,
        which implies the doctrine, but is believed by many scholars to be a
        later insertion. Outside chaps. i and ii, the only passages which
        call for notice are iii. 22, iii. 23, and iv. 22.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may say at once
        that we have few new arguments to bring forward. The contentions we
        have to examine are familiar to every one who studies the question of
        the Virgin Birth. They have been brilliantly stated in two well-known
        articles in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Encyclopaedia Biblica</span></span>, one by P.
        W. Schmiedel (on <span class="tei tei-q">“Mary”</span>), and the
        other by Usener (<span class="tei tei-q">“Nativity”</span>). In a
        review (HJ., vol. i, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg
        024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> no.
        1, p. 164), Dr. Moffatt justly describes these articles as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“competent and first-rate essays, which
        deserve alert recognition”</span>. But both these articles not only
        deny that the Virgin Birth was an original element in the Third
        Gospel, but also that St. Luke, the companion of St. Paul, ever
        taught that doctrine—and this without any linguistic examination of
        the passage i. 34 f. They provide, in fact, a clear illustration of
        the point we have already discussed. Inasmuch, then, as our purpose
        is to consider the question, Was the Virgin Birth an original element
        in the Third Gospel?, interpreted in its strictest terms, we shall
        need to state and weigh the arguments afresh. This is the more
        desirable, because, in the form in which these scholars present their
        case, each argument is put forward with an assurance and a finality
        which individually it does not merit. It is the cumulative force of a
        number of arguments, each of which has strong presumptive value,
        which ultimately carries conviction; not a series of arguments each
        of which is conclusive in itself. We do not suppose, of course, that
        a writer like Schmiedel would deny anything so obvious as this.
        Nevertheless, very many English readers feel that his several
        arguments are stated too much in the light of the result. Moreover,
        they appear to be shaped by presuppositions which are themselves
        fatal to the Virgin Birth. In the present treatment of the question,
        an attempt will be made to assign to each argument its proper force,
        to observe its limitations as well as its cogency. The result sought
        is not a conclusion to which we can append a triumphant Q. E. D., but
        that hypothesis, whatever it be, which best explains the observed
        facts taken as a whole.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the great
            majority of existing MSS. this passage reads as in the RV.,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am

            pleased”</span>. But in Codex Bezae, supported by Old Latin MSS.
            and by quotations in Justin and Clement, the passage reads,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Thou art my Son: to-day have I begotten
            Thee</span></span>”</span>. Blass (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philology of the
            Gospels</span></span>, p. 168 f.) believes this to be the genuine
            Lukan reading, and explains the common text as <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“a product of assimilation to the other
            Gospels”</span>. Usener (EB., col. 3348) also accepts the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Western”</span> reading, and says,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus the passage in Lk. was read, in the
            Greek Church down to about 300 <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> and in the Latin
            West down to and beyond 360 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>”</span> Dr. Moffatt
            (INT., 3rd ed., p. 269) goes so far as to say that the Lukan
            reading <span class="tei tei-q">“undoubtedly was υἱός μου εἷ σύ·
            ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε”</span>. He follows this reading in his
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Translation of the New
            Testament</span></span>, and says (p. 74), <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“In the other MSS. it has been altered, for
            harmonistic reasons”</span>. These opinions, and the arguments
            upon which they rest, have great weight. If the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Western”</span> reading is accepted, a strong
            presumption is set up against the view that the Third Gospel
            originally contained the Virgin Birth; for it is very difficult
            to believe that the hand which wrote, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“To-day have I begotten Thee”</span>, had already
            described the miraculous birth. (Cf. also Harnack, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Sayings</span></span>, pp. 310 ff.)</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first sight
            Blass's argument would seem to show a way of escape from this
            conclusion. He defends the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Western”</span> reading by showing the close
            connexion which it has with the following verse. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">to-day</span></em> have I begotten
            Thee’</span> stands in opposition to the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">‘thirty years’</span>, and the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">‘Thou art <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">my</span></em> Son’</span> likewise to
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘being as was supposed the son of
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Joseph</span></em>’</span> ”</span> (op.
            cit., p. 169). The phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“as was
            supposed”</span> (verse 23) will fall to be discussed next.
            Meanwhile we may observe that the connexion which Blass notes is
            actually strengthened if what St. Luke originally wrote was
            <span class="tei tei-q">“being the son of Joseph”</span>. This is
            the real point in the parallelism, as Blass himself indicates by
            printing the name Joseph in italics.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Western”</span> reading is to be
            accepted, a very interesting question arises as regards St.
            Luke's conception of the Baptism of Jesus. There is no need to
            suppose that he looked upon it as the occasion of the imparting
            of the Divine Sonship. If the connexion which Blass notes be
            allowed, it is probably purely literary, and the form in which
            St. Luke reports the logion is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> determined by his recollection of Ps. ii.
            7.<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=
            "#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>
            There is no intention, that is to say, on his part, of describing
            an act of deification or even adoption. But if the connexion is
            literary, we return again to the question, Can we think that St.
            Luke would have written the passage in this form, if he had
            already described the miraculous birth? Can we explain his
            deliberate preference for the language of Ps. ii. 7? The answer
            is, we feel bound to say, It is difficult, if it is not
            impossible. The force of this argument rests, nevertheless, upon
            the confidence with which we can accept the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Western”</span> reading; and while the present
            writer would favour that reading himself, he recognizes that its
            attestation is not such as to compel acceptance. Moffatt's claim
            that it <span class="tei tei-q">“undoubtedly was”</span> the
            Lukan reading is too strong. The most we can say is that it has
            great, if not very great, probability in its favour.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
            best at this point to consider the question of the Lukan
            Genealogy, and also the passage to which attention has just been
            called: <span class="tei tei-q">“being the son (as was supposed)
            of Joseph”</span> (RV.).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An examination
            of the Genealogy reveals the fact that it is artificially
            constructed, it is an arrangement of names in multiples of seven
            (cf. Sanday, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Outlines</span></span>, p. 202). The whole
            list contains seventy-seven names. From Adam to Abraham there are
            twenty-one names (7 x 3); from Isaac to David fourteen names (7 x
            2), if we include, as we probably should, the name Admin, as in
            the RV. margin; from Nathan to Shealtiel twenty-one names; and
            from Zerubbabel to Christ twenty-one names. Not only is this so,
            but in order to preserve the symbolic arrangement, names are
            repeated and omitted. Thus in verse 36, the compiler has
            preferred the LXX to the Hebrew. This permits the name Cainan to
            be introduced into the Genealogy twice, as the son of Arphaxad in
            verse 36, and again as the son of Enos in verse 37. No Hebrew MS.
            mentions Cainan as the son of Arphaxad. Again, in the list from
            Isaac to David, the name Ram (cf. 1 Chron. ii. 10 and Ruth iv.
            19) is omitted, and in its <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> place the two names Admin and Arni appear.
            Whatever be the explanation of these facts, it is significant
            that in this way the symmetrical arrangement is preserved.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
            probable that a Genealogy of such an artificial character was
            constructed by St. Luke himself. He shows no predilection for
            symbolic numbers in his writings, and does not indeed appear to
            observe this feature in the list. (Cf. Sanday, op. cit., p. 202,
            and contrast Mt. i. 17.) Probably he found the Genealogy ready to
            hand. The fact that it traces the descent to Adam may have
            appealed to him, in view of his own bent of mind, and it may have
            been this feature in the list which led him to incorporate it in
            his Gospel. The words <span class="tei tei-q">“the son of
            God”</span> with which the list ends, may be due to St. Luke
            himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“added for the sake of Gentile

            race”</span> (Plummer, ICC., St. Luke, p. 105)·</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It does not
            seem likely that the Genealogy in its original form, in the form,
            that is to say, in which St. Luke found it, contained the words
            which now stand in iii. 23, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as was
            supposed</span></span>”</span>. It is generally allowed at the
            present day that the Genealogies, both in the First Gospel and in
            the Third, trace the ancestry of Jesus through Joseph. But unlike
            the Matthaean Genealogy, that in Lk. gives us no reason to
            suppose that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">legal</span></em> descent only is traced in
            it. It is therefore difficult to believe that its author intended
            to construct a chain of descent in which the vital link should
            contain the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“as was
            supposed”</span>. These words more naturally give the impression
            of being a later insertion intended to adapt the Genealogy to a
            new situation. For our present purpose the important question is,
            Are these words the words of St. Luke?, and what is still more
            vital, At what point, if Lukan, were they inserted in the
            Genealogy,—when it was first incorporated in the Gospel, or at
            some subsequent time? If from the first they stood where they now
            stand, it is obvious that the Third Gospel taught the Virgin
            Birth from the beginning. If, on the other hand, they were added
            after the Gospel was written (or its earlier chapters), this
            supports the view that the doctrine is a later element.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The data at
            present at our disposal do not enable us to decide between these
            alternatives. We may argue <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> that it is
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name=
            "Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> unlikely that St.
            Luke would have thought it worth while to introduce the Genealogy
            at all, if at the time when he wove it into his Gospel he had
            realized the necessity of interpolating the words <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“as was supposed”</span>. In other words, we may say
            that had he known of the Virgin Birth from the first he would
            never have made use of the Genealogy. And further, we may argue
            that we best conserve St. Luke's reputation as a skilful writer
            by supposing the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“as was
            supposed”</span> to be a correction, introduced to make the best
            of a Genealogy, used in the first place under presuppositions
            which new information had now led him to discard. Short of
            excising the Genealogy altogether—we may say—he did the best he
            could. But such speculations, however attractive, do not lead to
            a conclusion which we can regard with confidence. It is better to
            leave iii. 23 to depend upon the conclusion to which we come with
            regard to i. 34 f. This is the crucial passage, and if this
            should prove to be a later insertion, then iii. 23 must also be
            regarded as such, introduced by the same hand at the same time
            and for the same reasons.</p>

            ii</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now to
            examine the narratives of Lk. ii, and to ask, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Under what
            presuppositions were they shaped?</span></span> The incidents
            which call for special notice are the Purifying, the meeting with
            Simeon in the Temple, and the visit of Jesus to Jerusalem at the
            age of twelve. The five passages which speak of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the parents”</span> of Jesus will be considered
            separately. There is no need to dwell on the story of the visit
            of the shepherds. It goes without saying that it nowhere
            presupposes the Virgin Birth. On the other hand, there is nothing
            in the presentation of the story which is alien to the
            doctrine.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Turning to the
            story of the Purifying in Lk. ii. 22-4, we are met by the
            question, What are we to understand by the phrase <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">their purification</span></span>”</span>
            (ii. 22)? Attempts have been made to take the pronoun as
            referring to the mother and the child, but, in view of the
            construction of the passage, this exegesis is impossible. Joseph
            and Mary are clearly the unexpressed subject of the verb in the
            sentence in which the pronoun <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“their”</span> occurs (<span class="tei tei-q">“And
            when the days of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">their</span></em> purification ... were
            fulfilled, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">they</span></em> brought him up to
            Jerusalem”</span>). Schmiedel holds that the word <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“their”</span> refers <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> to Joseph and Mary,<a id="noteref_30" name=
            "noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> and
            without doubt this opinion is correct. But if this is so, is it
            probable that St. Luke had the thought of a virgin birth in the
            background of his mind when he first penned the phrase? Is not
            the pronoun one which we may think he would have been anxious to
            avoid? Nor was there any need for him to introduce it, since,
            according to the Levitical law, it was only the mother who was
            made unclean by a birth (cf. Lev. xii). Schmiedel, who calls
            attention to this fact, thinks that the writer has made
            <span class="tei tei-q">“an archaeological error”</span>.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“This error serves to show that the
            writer regarded Joseph as the actual father of Jesus; otherwise
            he could not have thought of him at all as unclean”</span> (EB.,
            col. 2955). Even if we think that Schmiedel's remorseless logic
            is too confidently applied, the fact remains that St. Luke's
            pronoun is as unnecessary as it is ambiguous. The difficulty of
            the expression is not felt by the modern mind alone. It is
            reflected in two subsequent textual alterations. Instead of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“their purification”</span>, the Codex
            Bezae reads <span class="tei tei-q">“his purification”</span>,
            and the Sin. Syr. MS., together with the cursive 76, has the
            pronoun <span class="tei tei-q">“her”</span>. The textual
            evidence forbids us to accept the reading <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“her purification”</span>, but this is assuredly the
            phrase we should expect a writer to use who has just told the
            story of a virgin birth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the two
            remaining stories, that of the meeting with Simeon, and that of
            the visit of Jesus to Jerusalem, there is a common element which
            provokes reflection in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">the surprise of Joseph and Mary</span></em>.
            In reference to the prophecy of Simeon concerning Jesus, we are
            told that they <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">were marvelling
            at</span></span>”</span> the things that were said (ii. 33). We
            can readily account for this remark, if St. Luke had no knowledge
            of the Virgin Birth at the time of writing, for the prophecy of
            Simeon transcends that of the angelic announcement of i. 31-3.
            Whereas the latter does not leave the soil of Israel, the former
            speaks of a revelation to the Gentiles. We could say, then, that
            the wider scope of the prophecy of Simeon provides room for
            wonder. But can we say this if St. Luke believed Mary to have
            received the announcement of a virgin birth, which, moreover, had
            been fulfilled? Would he have thought any prophecy called for
            wonder after such facts as <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> these? The same difficulty arises in the
            story of the visit to the Temple. After St. Luke has recorded the
            pregnant words of Jesus, <span class="tei tei-q">“Wist ye not
            that I must be in my Father's house?”</span>, he writes:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">And they understood not the saying which he
            spake unto them</span></span>”</span> (ii. 50). If, in this case,
            as distinguished from ii. 33, the Evangelist had said that they
            marvelled, the difficulty would be less great. It might then have
            been argued that, inasmuch as the facts of His birth had not been
            made known to the boy Jesus, there was room for wonder that
            already He should have attained to such a consciousness of filial
            relationship to God. But to say that they did not understand His
            words is an astonishing statement on the part of a writer who
            believes the Virgin Birth. On the other hand, it is a perfectly
            natural remark, if we can presume the Evangelist to have written
            in the absence of such a belief.<a id="noteref_31" name=
            "noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Speaking of
            the narratives of Lk. ii, as a whole, we may say that, apart from
            the references to <span class="tei tei-q">“the parents”</span>,
            which remain to be considered, distinct difficulties are raised
            if we must believe that St. Luke knew of the Virgin Birth at the
            time when he first wrote the chapter, and that greater justice
            can be done to the narratives if we can presume him to have
            written them without that knowledge. How far this view is
            supported by the five passages which speak of Joseph and Mary, we
            have now to consider.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 120%">(d) The References to Joseph and
            Mary in Lk. ii</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These passages
            are as follows: ii. 27, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
            parents</span></span>”</span>; ii. 41 and 43, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">his parents</span></span>”</span>; ii. 33,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">his father and his
            mother</span></span>”</span>; and ii. 48, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">thy father and I</span></span>”</span>. The
            point to be considered is whether we can suppose St. Luke to have
            known of the Virgin Birth at the time when he used these
            expressions.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last
            passage (ii. 48) differs from the rest, and should not be
            pressed. It is reasonable to urge that, in addressing the boy
            Jesus, Mary would naturally speak in this way, even if the Virgin
            Birth is historically true; and that it is conceivable that
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name=
            "Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> St. Luke, while
            himself holding the doctrine, should have been so far faithful to
            his sources as to preserve Mary's words in this form.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
            respect the four passages which remain are quite different,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in that
            they are expressions which St. Luke himself
            employs</span></span>. This gives them a distinctive character
            which has often been overlooked. It has been too frequently
            assumed that these passages are of like character to those which
            belong to the story of Jesus at the synagogue at Nazareth. In
            this incident the Jews speak of Jesus as <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the carpenter's son”</span> (Mt. xiii. 55. Cf. Mk.
            vi. 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“the carpenter, the son of
            Mary”</span>). St. Luke, who records the same incident, but
            perhaps follows a special source of his own (Lk. iv. 16 ff.),
            gives the question in the form, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is not
            this Joseph's son?”</span> With regard to these passages, it is
            open to any one to urge that in them we have instances of the
            accuracy with which the Gospels record contemporary beliefs,
            which were natural but erroneous. The language of the Jews, it
            may be said, is justified by ignorance of the true facts, and its
            retention by Evangelists who teach the Virgin Birth is evidence
            of their fidelity to detail. This is a reasonable argument, and
            it cannot be gainsaid, until the whole question has been faced
            (again, as in the case of ii. 48). But the four passages in Lk.
            ii stand upon an entirely different footing. In these passages it
            is not a question of what is justified by ignorance, but of what
            is possible in the light of knowledge. Assuming that we have to
            do with a writer who believes Jesus to be the son of Mary by the
            direct operation of the Holy Ghost, we have to ask whether,
            believing this, and having (on this assumption) just stated this
            very thing, that writer would be at all likely to speak of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the parents”</span>, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“his parents”</span>, and, indeed, to use an
            expression so definite as <span class="tei tei-q">“his father and
            his mother”</span>. In short, granting that St. Luke has recorded
            the language of the Nazarenes, can we suppose that he would have
            used the same language himself in the light of the Virgin Birth?
            It is not as if these modes of speech were indispensable. The
            words <span class="tei tei-q">“Joseph and Mary”</span> could
            easily have been employed, and in this way all danger of
            ambiguity removed. In the face of a fact so unique as a virgin
            birth, one would expect an effort to avoid ambiguity; all the
            more, in the case of a writer, with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> whose apt choice of words and delicacy of
            expression scholars like Ramsay and Harnack have made us
            familiar.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In saying this
            we are not guilty of imposing modern canons of accuracy upon an
            ancient writer. The difficulties we ourselves feel have long been
            felt. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is very noteworthy that six old
            Latin codices in ii. 41 have <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ioseph et
            Maria</span></span> for <span class="tei tei-q">‘his
            parents’</span> (οἱ γονεῖς αὐτοῦ); most uncials in ii. 33
            substitute <span class="tei tei-q">‘Joseph’</span> (ὁ ιωσηφ) for
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘his father’</span> (ὁ πατὴρ
            αὐτοῦ)”</span> (Schmiedel, EB., col. 2955). None of these
            readings can claim, of course, to be original, since admittedly
            they represent attempts to remove difficulties. Their
            significance lies in the fact that they indicate that those
            difficulties have long been felt. They show that we are not
            asking an ancient writer to conform to modern standards, when we
            assert that St. Luke has expressed himself with an ambiguity
            which it is difficult, if not impossible, to understand, if he
            wrote from the first in the knowledge of the Virgin Birth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The impression
            made by the narratives of Lk. ii is thus deepened and confirmed
            by the several references to Joseph and Mary.</p>

            the facts examined thus far is in the direction of showing the
            Virgin Birth to belong to a later stratum in the Gospel. One
            passage in Lk. ii might seem to invalidate this view. In the
            Revised Version, verse 5 reads: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">to enrol himself with Mary, who was
            betrothed to him, being great with child</span></span>”</span>.
            These words, if they must stand, imply that the Virgin Birth is
            known to the writer. But, apart altogether from the historical
            character of the miracle, it is highly probable that we ought to
            read: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">with Mary his
            wife</span></span>”</span>.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32"

            is the reading of the Sinaitic Syriac and of the Old Latin MSS.
            a, b, c; and the word <span class="tei tei-q">“wife”</span>
            together with <span class="tei tei-q">“betrothed”</span>, also
            appears in AC<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            is one of the cases in which <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Western”</span> readings, where Old Syriac and Old
            Latin MSS. agree, probably preserve an original text.<a id=

            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> When
            we add the argument of transcriptional probability, it is
            difficult to resist this conclusion. One can easily understand
            how the reading <span class="tei tei-q">“with Mary his
            wife”</span> could come to be altered to <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“with Mary, who was betrothed to him”</span> by those
            who imagined that the former was inconsistent with the Virgin
            Birth. But, if the words <span class="tei tei-q">“with Mary, who
            was betrothed to him”</span> stood in the primitive text, can we
            give any satisfactory explanation of the change? When we consider
            that from New Testament times the Virgin Birth was part of the
            faith of the Church, questioned by few save the Ebionites and
            some of the Gnostic sects, the supposition that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“with Mary his wife”</span> is a later corruption,
            becomes improbable in the extreme. It is hardly sufficient to
            adopt Plummer's suggestion, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            γυναικί of A. Vulg. Syr. and Aeth. is a gloss, but a correct
            one”</span> (op. cit., p. 53). Must we not find more than a
            gloss? Moreover, is this a satisfactory explanation of the Sin.
            Syr. and of those Old Latin MSS. which have <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“wife”</span> without <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“betrothed”</span>? We should probably conclude that
            in this instance the <span class="tei tei-q">“Western”</span>
            reading, supported by transcriptional probability, must outweigh
            the evidence of even the great uncials, and that what St. Luke
            wrote was <span class="tei tei-q">“with Mary his
            wife”</span>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this view
            is sound, the verse in itself is not necessarily inconsistent
            with the Virgin Birth, since it may reasonably be urged that it
            carries us no further than Mt. i. 24, where the marriage is
            implied.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href=
            "#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

            this fact is put forward in a narrative <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> which expressly teaches the Virgin Birth,
            it could be so here. The phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“with
            Mary his wife”</span> is certainly congruous with the view that
            the doctrine is a later element in the Third Gospel, but it would
            be improper to employ it in support of that view. (The case is
            like those of ii. 48, iv. 22.) But even if we must leave the
            question open, at any rate we have no longer to reckon with the
            words, <span class="tei tei-q">“with Mary, who was betrothed to
            him”</span>. There is nothing, therefore, in the verse which is
            in conflict with the view that St. Luke had no knowledge of the
            Virgin Birth when he first wrote his Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before leaving
            this part of the subject it may be well to recall the nature of
            the argument. The several points treated are not regarded as
            contentions which inexorably demand a certain conclusion, but as
            distinct difficulties, greater or less, which arise, on the view
            that St. Luke knew of the Virgin Birth from the first. We may
            fairly say that the facts examined thus far would be best
            satisfied by considering the Virgin Birth as a later element in
            the Gospel; but, until we have investigated the important passage
            Lk. i. 34 f., it would be precarious to say more.</p>

          the assumption we have made thus far, that Lk. i. 34 f. implies the

            f</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the text as
            it stands, in answer to the angel's words in Lk. i. 30-3, Mary
            says: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">How shall this be,
            seeing I know not</span></span> (οὐ γινώσκω) <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a
            man?</span></span>”</span> The interpretation of this verse
            depends upon the force we give to the word γινώσκω. Schmiedel
            (EB., col. 2956) thinks that γινώσκω in this verse <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“cannot mean the act of concubitus for which the word
            is often employed”</span>, because it is here used in the present
            tense. On the other hand, the quite general sense of knowledge in
            the way of acquaintanceship, is also, in his view, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“equally precluded”</span>, since it would be
            <span class="tei tei-q">“quite meaningless in the present
            context”</span>. Accordingly, he finds the true interpretation to
            be <span class="tei tei-q">“the intermediate one; I have no such
            acquaintanceship with any man as might lead to the fulfilment of
            this prophecy”</span>. In other words, Mary's objection or
            difficulty is that she is not even betrothed. Schmiedel is not
            daunted by the fact that this interpretation is in conflict with
            Lk. i. 27 (<span class="tei tei-q">“a virgin betrothed to a man
            whose name was Joseph”</span>). Indeed, the contradiction is
            given as one reason for regarding Lk. i. 34 f. as a later
            insertion. In this respect Schmiedel's view will probably not
            command much support. He gives no example of γινώσκω used in the
            special sense in which he interprets it, and fails to justify his
            rejection of the common use of the verb. (See Th-Gr., p. 117;
            VGT., p. 127.) It is altogether preferable to follow Dr. Plummer
            (op. cit., p. 24), whose view is indicated in the references
            which he gives to the OT. passages, Gen. xix. 8; Judg. xi. 39;
            Num. xxxi. 17. <span class="tei tei-q">“The words”</span>, says
            Dr. Plummer, <span class="tei tei-q">“are the avowal of a maiden
            conscious of her own purity”</span>. According to this view the
            phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“seeing I know not a man”</span>
            must be interpreted of the marital relationship. Mary's
            perplexity is that she, an unmarried woman, is promised an
            immediate conception. It is impossible to accept Schmiedel's
            view, when he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Mary takes the words
            of the angel as referring to a fulfilment in the way of
            nature”</span>. This explanation is, of course, consistent on the
            interpretation which Schmiedel gives to Mary's question, but not
            on that which we have found <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> reason to prefer. Had Mary understood the
            angelic message to mean a natural human birth after marriage,
            there would have been no cause for perplexity. Her words,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“How shall this be, seeing I know not a
            man?”</span>, are clearly <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">a reply to what is understood as the
            announcement of an immediate conception</span></span>, and not of
            a birth within the marriage tie.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this view
            is taken of Mary's words, it follows that verse 35 must be
            explained as the yet clearer announcement of a virgin birth,
            supernaturally caused. If the verse is treated in itself, it is
            possible to interpret it of an ordinary human birth, and there is
            much that is attractive in the interpretation. The words may be
            said to speak of the Holy Ghost who should come upon Mary to
            inspire and preserve the purity of her soul in the act of
            conception. They may speak, that is to say, of God's use of His
            own appointed agencies. But, to accept this view, it would be
            necessary to regard the words <span class="tei tei-q">“seeing I
            know not a man”</span> as a later insertion, and, though this
            opinion has been held by some (including Kattenbusch, Weinel, J.
            M. Thompson), it does not on the whole commend itself as a
            satisfactory solution of the problem (see further pp. 69 ff.). We
            are compelled therefore to accept the ordinary interpretation of
            verse 35, as implying the Miraculous Conception.</p>

            Announcement in Lk. i. 30-3</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In treating
            Mary's question in Lk. i. 34. we have concluded that it reflects
            the point of view of one who has received the announcement of a
            miraculous birth. But this conclusion does not compel us to
            interpret the words of Lk. i. 30-3 as containing such an
            announcement. We have to examine the passage so as to determine
            whether as a matter of fact it is susceptible of that
            interpretation. That its present context requires this view of
            Lk. i. 30-3 is a fact not lightly to be regarded; nevertheless,
            it must find justification <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">within the passage itself</span></em> before
            it can be accepted.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Revised
            Version, the angelic message reads as follows: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour

            shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call

            over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall
            be no end.</span></span>”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have
            already expressed the view that this prophecy moves strictly
            within Jewish limits (p. 29). Detailed study of the passage only
            serves to confirm this opinion. The Sonship mentioned in verse 32
            bears a purely Messianic character. Dr. Plummer justly remarks:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The title υἱὸς ᾿Υψίστου expresses some
            very close relation between Jesus and Jehovah, but not the Divine
            Sonship in the Trinity”</span> (op. cit., p. 23). <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nothing is either
            said or implied in this announcement of a miraculous
            birth.</span></span> The terms of the promise to Mary would be
            perfectly fulfilled by an ordinary birth within the marriage tie,
            so far, that is to say, as the mode of birth is concerned. We
            must therefore reject the view which speaks of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the strange declaration that she is to bear a son
            before she is married”</span> (Plummer). We look in vain for this
            declaration. We agree that Mary's question in verse 34 demands
            such a declaration in order to make it rational. In fact, we
            ourselves have argued that verse 34 is <span class="tei tei-q">“a
            reply to what is understood as the announcement of an immediate
            conception”</span>. Nevertheless, even on the most generous
            interpretation of Lk. i. 30-3, it is impossible to find in the
            passage any such announcement.<a id="noteref_35" name=
            "noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a>
            There is thus a radical difference of point of view between the
            angelic announcement of Lk. i. 30-3 and Mary's question in Lk. i.
            34. This difference of standpoint will be urged as one, though
            not the only reason for regarding Lk. i. 34 f. as a later
            insertion. But before we examine these reasons, we need to
            consider whether after all the angelic announcement may not
            contain some implication (which does not lie upon the surface of
            the passage) that a Miraculous Conception is promised.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find it
            impossible to rest satisfied in the suggestion of W. C. Allen,
            that there may have been some unrecorded indication of something
            unique in the conception (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            A suggestion of this kind can neither be justified <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id=
            "Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> nor gainsaid, and is valuable
            only as a confirmation of the view that there is nothing
            <span class="tei tei-q">“recorded”</span> in Lk. i. 30-3 of a
            unique conception. To launch upon the waters of what is
            unrecorded would seem to be a policy of despair. There is much
            more to be said for an extremely interesting suggestion of Canon
            Box in his article on the Virgin Birth in Hastings's <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dictionary of
            Christ and the Gospels</span></span> (see vol. ii, p. 806 a). Box
            argues that in the angelic announcement of Lk. i. 30-3
            <span class="tei tei-q">“an immediate conception is
            meant”</span>. Accepting the view that a Hebrew original
            underlies the nativity-narratives of Lk. i, ii, he thinks that
            this original has been incorrectly translated in Lk. i. 31,
            where, in the Greek, we have the future tense συλλήψῃ,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“thou shalt conceive”</span>.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Hebrew original of συλλήψῃ would be
            a participle”</span>, he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“and the
            exact rendering would be, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Behold, thou
            art conceiving now’</span> ”</span>. There can be no doubt that,
            if this view can be allowed, the angelic announcement really does
            speak of a miraculous birth, and thus an adequate explanation is
            given of Mary's surprise in Lk. i. 34. There are, however,
            certain objections which, in the judgement of the present writer,
            appear to be fatal to this theory. We need not press the
            objection that it rests upon an initial assumption, the existence
            of the supposed Hebrew original, since this theory of a Hebrew
            (or Aramaic) documentary source is accepted by most British
            scholars. Nor is it more than a formal objection if we question
            if the word συλλήψῃ would necessarily be represented in the
            supposed Hebrew original by a participle. In the Hebrew NT.
            published by the British and Foreign Bible Society, the adjective
            הָרָה is used, and this is the case in similar passages in the
            Hebrew OT., viz. Gen. xvi. 11, xxxviii. 24; Judg. xiii. 7 (verse
            3, perf.); 1 Sam. iv. 19; 2 Sam. xi. 5; Isa. vii. 14. A more
            serious objection arises from Lk. ii. 21, where it is said that
            the name Jesus was so called by the angel <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“before he was conceived in the womb”</span> (πρὸ τοῦ
            συλληφθῆναι αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ). On the theory we are
            considering, this must be held to be either a second
            mistranslation of the Hebrew original, or a departure from it. In
            either case we must conclude that a promised conception, and not
            an immediate one, was the considered view of the translator of
            the Hebrew document. A second and conclusive objection to the
            theory of Canon Box rests upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> questions of grammatical syntax. Is it
            correct to say that <span class="tei tei-q">“the exact
            rendering”</span> of the participle (or adj.) would be,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, thou art conceiving now”</span>?
            It is true that the active participle is <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“mainly descriptive of something present”</span>
            (Davidson, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Hebrew Syntax</span></span>, p. 134), but it
            is also true, to quote the same authority, that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the participle does not indicate time, its colour in
            this respect being taken from the connexion in which it
            stands”</span>. The same consideration also applies to הָרָה in
            all the OT. instances referred to above. Where it is made clear
            in the context that conception has already taken place, הָרָה is
            translated in the RV. by the present (cf. Gen. xvi. 11, xxxviii.
            24; 2 Sam. xi. 5). Where, however, there is no such indication,
            it is rendered by the future, and the announcement is treated as
            a promise (cf. Judg. xiii. 7).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To convict the
            translator of the Hebrew document of an error in translation, it
            is clearly necessary to show from the context of Lk. i. 31 that
            conception has already taken place. In other words, the
            translation preferred by Canon Box, if it is to be accepted, must
            be justified by some statement, either previously made, or made
            within the angelic announcement itself; it must be required, that
            is to say, by something in the narrative previous to Mary's
            question in Lk. i. 34.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href=
            "#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> But
            these conditions, which are by no means arbitrary, cannot be met.
            We must, therefore, conclude that the translator was quite
            justified, when he used the future (συλλήψῃ), and so represented
            the announcement as a prophecy; and we must draw this conclusion,
            irrespective altogether of the difference of point of view which
            thus stands revealed between this announcement and verse 34 in
            the connexion in which it now appears. Indeed, the argument of
            Canon Box seems capable of being employed in a direction the very
            reverse of that intended. It could be argued that since, in point
            of fact, the translator has used the future in verse 31, there
            was nothing in the Hebrew original to suggest to his mind the
            idea of an <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg
            040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            immediate conception; not even the statement of verse 34, which
            might have suggested, though it does not justify, the rendering,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, thou art conceiving now”</span>.
            Thus we might enlist the considered view of the translator, that
            a promised conception is meant, in support of the contention that
            Lk. i. 34 f. is a later insertion. Without pressing this view, we
            may fairly say that there is much more to be said for it than for
            the theory we have discussed. The latter theory, in spite of all
            that can be urged in its favour, fails to justify itself. In that
            case its failure seems to illustrate the somewhat desperate
            expedients to which we must have recourse, in order to find in
            the angelic announcement the thought of an immediate conception.
            On the question as a whole, we can only conclude that such a view
            is neither stated nor implied in the announcement, but that, on
            the contrary, its reference is to the future.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having sought
            to give their full force and proper meaning to the two passages,
            Lk. i. 30-3 and Lk. i. 34 f., we may now consider the arguments
            which can be advanced in favour of regarding the latter passage
            as an interpolation. In respect of these arguments, there is far
            from general agreement among those who are at one in the
            conclusion reached. But the significant fact is not the diversity
            of opinion as regards the mode of proof, but the agreement of so
            many scholars in holding the passage to be a later
            insertion.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href=
            "#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> The
            arguments we shall examine are not equally cogent, and, as in the
            first part of the present chapter, we shall call attention to
            their limitations as well as to the points in which they are
            strong. We shall also treat the case entirely apart from the
            results suggested in the first half of our inquiry. Those
            results, if valid, set up a presupposition against Lk. i. 34 f.
            But it seems much the best not to avail ourselves of such an
            argument, but rather to consider the passage in itself and in
            relation to its context. If in this way we find reasonable
            grounds for considering Lk. i. 34 f. to be <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id=
            "Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a later insertion, we have
            then a double series of arguments converging on one
            conclusion.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The first
            point to be considered is that <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">verse 36 follows
            naturally after verse 33</span></span>. As we have seen, in
            verses 30-3 we have an angelic announcement to Mary to the effect
            that she is to give birth to a son who is destined to become the
            Messiah. He will be called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Son of
            the Most High”</span>, and to him the Lord God will give
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the throne of his father David”</span>.
            To this message, it may be said, verses 36 and 37 form a fitting
            sequel. They add the assurance that <span class="tei tei-q">“no
            word from God shall be void of power”</span>, in proof of which
            it is declared that Mary's kinswoman, Elisabeth, is shortly to
            bear a son in her old age. The whole speech (Lk. i. 30-3, 36, 37)
            is a consistent passage, and in relation to it the words of Mary
            in verse 38—<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, the handmaid of the
            Lord; be it unto me according to thy word”</span>—are a natural
            and fitting reply. Canon Box, in the article already cited,
            questions this view. <span class="tei tei-q">“There would be
            nothing extraordinary”</span>, he says <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“in Mary's conceiving a son as Joseph's
            wife”</span>—nothing, that is to say, to require the sign
            offered. But surely it is not a question of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“conceiving a son”</span>, but of conceiving such a
            son, the long-promised Messiah; and, moreover, the ratification
            of so great a promise by means of a miracle is a commonplace of
            OT. thought. It is not suggested, of course, that this argument
            proves Lk. i. 34 f. to be an interpolation. That a section runs
            smoothly when a particular passage within it is excised, is no
            proof that that passage is not original. This last conclusion
            must be established on the ground of other arguments. If,
            however, in the present instance, other arguments carry weight,
            then the fact that verse 36 can be connected easily and naturally
            with verse 33 becomes of very great importance, and it is for
            that reason that we introduce it here.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) We take a
            really decisive step when we instance what already has been
            found, namely that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">verse 34 follows quite unnaturally upon Lk.
            i. 30-3</span></span>. We have seen that Mary's question implies
            the announcement of an immediate conception, and we have failed
            to find any such announcement in the angel's words. There is thus
            a complete difference of point of view in the two passages. No
            possible ground is provided in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> angelic announcement for the objection
            raised in verse 34. It is difficult, therefore, to deny the
            suggestion that Mary's question already implies a knowledge of
            what is told for the first time in verse 35. But this view, if we
            accept it, is to say that Mary's question could not possibly have
            been present to the mind of Mary in the connexion in which it
            stands; it was the last question she would have thought of
            asking. The question can only have been put into her mouth by one
            who already knew of the Virgin Birth, and wished to introduce
            that doctrine into a context in which originally it did not
            appear. On the interpretation which we have given to Lk. i. 30-3
            and Lk. i. 34 f., this conclusion is inevitable, unless we prefer
            to find in St. Luke an utter inconsecutiveness of thought which
            does him no credit as writer, and which neither of his works
            justify us in attributing to him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) We are
            unable to attach the same force to the contention that verse 35
            is followed unnaturally by verses 36 and 37 (so Schmiedel),
            though this view has something to be said for it. Verse 35
            announces the virgin birth of the promised Messiah, a doctrine
            which is not found in Jewish literature and tradition, and for
            which, therefore, the mind of Mary must have been utterly
            unprepared.<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href=
            "#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> As
            the section now stands, the statement of verses 36 and 37 is
            added as a sign that what has just been promised will surely come
            to pass. This sign, we have already argued, would be quite
            natural, according to OT. modes of thought, as authenticating
            such a message as that given in Lk. i. 30-3. But can we say this
            in reference to the promise of a virgin birth? To the modern mind
            at least the argument seems faulty and unconvincing. Mary is
            bidden to accept as the divine promise what is so remarkable as
            to be otherwise unknown to her, on the ground of what is
            certainly remarkable but familiar to her mind and outlook. In
            truth, this seems a remarkable argument with which to credit an
            angel! At the same time, it has to be admitted that such an
            objection may be too stringent, and that it may not allow
            sufficiently for ancient modes of thought, according to which the
            argument from the less to the greater is by no means uncommon.
            For <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name=
            "Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> this reason the
            present writer would not feel confident in pressing the argument
            sketched above.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href=
            "#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) A much
            stronger argument calls attention to <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the similarity
            between Mary's question and that of Zacharias (Lk. i. 18), and
            the difference with which they are treated by the
            angel</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“Mary's speech
            expresses doubt of the truth of the angel's message, and yet she
            is not so much as blamed, whilst Zacharias is actually punished
            for a like doubt (i. 20)”</span>.<a id="noteref_40" name=
            "noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> The
            presumption is that the two cases do not emanate from the same
            cycle of tradition. The force of this argument depends, of
            course, upon the way in which we interpret Lk. i. 34. It is true
            that we have no indication of the tone in which the question is
            asked, beyond the words themselves and the sentences which
            follow; but quite sufficient is given to indicate the presence of
            doubt. The point is not merely one of subjective valuation. This
            will appear if we consider Plummer's view, which is quite
            different from Schmiedel's. <span class="tei tei-q">“She does not
            ask for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">proof</span></em>, as Zacharias did (ver.
            18); and only in the form of the words does she ask as to the
            mode of accomplishment. Her utterance is little more than an
            involuntary expression of amazement.... It is clear that she does
            not doubt the fact promised, nor for a moment suppose that her
            child is to be the child of Joseph”</span> (op. cit., p. 24). In
            weighing this opinion, it should be noticed that it refers only
            to the words, Πῶς ἔσται τοῦτο? We may readily agree that if all
            that Mary had said were, <span class="tei tei-q">“How shall this
            be?”</span>, we should be unable to contest this view. But to
            divide Mary's question in this way is not permissible. The second
            part, <span class="tei tei-q">“seeing I know not a man”</span>,
            clearly determines the first, and debars us from viewing it as
            merely <span class="tei tei-q">“an involuntary expression of
            amazement”</span>. The presence of doubt, we think, must be
            conceded, though it is less marked than in the case of
            Zacharias.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg
            044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This view,
            moreover, is supported by the fact that, in the narrative as it
            stands, an explanation follows, which is also confirmed by a
            sign. Since, as Plummer says, Mary, unlike Zacharias, does not
            ask for proof, we need not object that she is not <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“punished.”</span> And it is just possible that we
            make the parallelism too rigid if we lay stress on the fact that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“she is not so much as blamed”</span>. It
            is rather the <span class="tei tei-q">“eulogium”</span> of Lk. i.
            45 (<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed is she that
            believed”</span>) which presents the difficulty. It is true that,
            in the narrative as we have it now, Mary believes ultimately
            (verse 38), but Lk. i. 45 seems rather to belong to a narrative
            in which Mary believes from the first. We conclude that the
            present argument gives real support to the view that Lk. i. 34 f.
            belongs to a source distinct from its context.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) A fifth
            argument dwells on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">the different senses</span></em> in which
            Divine Sonship is predicated of the promised child in verse 32 as
            compared with verse 35. As we have seen, the term υἱὸς ᾿Υψίστου
            in verse 32 is purely Messianic. But in verse 35 the expression
            υἱὸς θεοῦ must be given a very different meaning. It is in
            consequence of (διὸ καί) the divine overshadowing that the child
            is to be called <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of God”</span>.
            Here, to quote Dr. J. Estlin Carpenter, the term denotes
            <span class="tei tei-q">“not official adoption, but actual
            origin”</span>, and, with the same writer, we must conclude that
            verse 35 <span class="tei tei-q">“is thus a doublet of verses 31,
            32 on another plane”</span> (op. cit., p. 487).<a id="noteref_41"
            name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> It
            is more difficult to decide whether the difference supports the
            theory of interpolation. We cannot shut out the possibility that
            two diverse types of Sonship might have been attributed by St.
            Luke to the same speaker at the same time of writing. But, having
            said this, we may observe that it is certainly much easier to
            suppose, and is much more probable, that they belong to different
            periods of reflection, and are the product (or deposit) of
            different traditions. This argument, then, may be said to lean in
            the direction of the theory of interpolation, but, for the reason
            given above, we should hesitate to urge it, if it stood
            alone.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(6) We have
            lastly to look at the vexed question of the Davidic descent. It
            is safe to say that, if we had not Lk. i. 34 f. in the Gospel as
            it stands to-day, we should have no ground for <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id=
            "Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> regarding Mary as of Davidic
            descent. It is the presence of these verses that makes possible
            that inference in verse 32, where, in addressing Mary, the angel
            speaks of David as the forefather of the promised child. It is
            surely a remarkable fact that a point so vital to St. Luke's
            narrative as the Davidic descent of Mary should be introduced in
            so incidental a manner. Our wonder is increased when we observe
            that St. Luke is at great pains to assure Theophilus of the
            Davidic descent of Joseph. In ii. 4 it is said that Joseph was
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">of the house and family of
            David</span></span>”</span>; not a word is said of Mary's
            descent. It is true that the Sin. Syr. reads, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“because they were both of the house of
            David”</span>; but this does not naturally fit into the structure
            of the sentence, is unsupported elsewhere, and is accepted by no
            one; it clearly represents an attempt to remove a difficulty. In.
            i. 27 it is also said that Joseph was <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">of the house of David</span></span>”</span>.
            The phrase cannot be construed with the word <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“virgin”</span>, which occurs earlier in the
            sentence, in view of the fact that after ἐξ οἴκου Δανείδ St. Luke
            resumes the thread of the story by saying <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“and the virgin's name was Mary”</span>; otherwise,
            he would have continued (so Schmiedel, op. cit., col. 2957),
            <span class="tei tei-q">“and her name was Mary”</span>. It is not
            easy indeed to resist Schmiedel's further contention that the
            phrasing of the sentence expressly forbids our ascribing the
            Davidic descent to Mary, though the opinion is put forward with
            greater confidence than seems justified. The one passage in which
            St. Luke directly refers to the family of Mary is dubious. In i.
            36 Elisabeth is said to be <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
            kinswoman</span></span>”</span> of Mary, and we know from i. 5
            that Elisabeth was <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of the daughters of
            Aaron</span></span>”</span>, which seems to imply that Mary too
            was of Levitical descent. But as the precise nature of the
            relationship is not stated, we cannot say, with Schmiedel,
            Usener, and others, that this is so. Nevertheless, the broad fact
            remains that apart from an inference, which itself depends on Lk.
            i. 34 f., we have no grounds for believing Mary to be a
            descendant of David. St. Luke undoubtedly believes Jesus to be of
            Davidic descent; he carefully shows Joseph to be of that descent;
            he gives us no reason to suppose, that, like the author of the
            First Gospel, he traced the descent of Jesus through Joseph as
            His <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">legal</span></em> father; and yet, in spite
            of all this, he has left the vital question of the Davidic
            descent of Mary at the mercy of an inference! If he knows Mary to
            be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name=
            "Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a descendant of
            David, why does he not say so explicitly? We have a right to ask
            the question, which is neither captious nor unfair. No one has
            yet answered it satisfactorily, except in the answer that St.
            Luke had no tradition of the Davidic descent of Mary at his
            disposal, that he traced the descent of Jesus through Joseph as
            His real father, that this is the true interpretation of verse
            32, and that Lk. i. 34 f. is a later insertion, which has imposed
            on verse 32 a sense which originally it did not bear.
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Regard
            Lk. i. 34 f. as a later insertion, and all the facts alleged by
            St. Luke about the Davidic descent fall into intelligible
            order</span></span>; refuse to do this, and they remain in
            inexplicable confusion.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we
            consider the cumulative force of the preceding arguments, it
            becomes impossible for us to think that Lk. i. 34 f. was written
            at the same time, and from the same point of view, as the context
            in which it now stands; it is clearly a later insertion. With
            some reason we may hesitate to say that verse 36 does not follow
            naturally upon verse 35, and we may speculate whether two diverse
            conceptions of Sonship may not be held in the same mind at the
            same time of writing. But when we ponder the question of the
            Davidic descent; when we compare verse 34 with Lk. i. 18 ff.;
            when we observe the natural coherence of Lk. i. 30-3 and Lk. i.
            36-8, and the radical difference in point of view between verses
            34, 35 and the angelic announcement; when, in short, we have a
            narrative, which, if Lk. i. 34 f. was present from the first,
            ought to be dominated by those verses, but on the contrary does
            not seem to be influenced by them; we are compelled to conclude
            that the suspected verses represent a later insertion in the
            Gospel.</p>

          Conclusion</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are in a
          position now to conclude from the foregoing investigation that
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          Virgin Birth is not an original element in the Third
          Gospel</span></span>. This conclusion has been reached by two lines
          of argument which confirm and strengthen each other. We have seen
          that the one passage which unmistakably asserts the doctrine is a
          later insertion. Independently of this, statements have been noted
          in chapters i and ii, which receive no natural and satisfactory
          explanation on the assumption that St. Luke wrote his narrative
          with a knowledge of the miracle <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> presupposed. In the first part of this
          chapter we expressly refrained from pressing the view that these
          points in themselves absolutely forbid this assumption. But,
          obviously, now that we have found Lk. i. 34 f. to be a later
          insertion, the force of these difficulties is greatly increased. We
          are now entitled to say that the opinion which does least honour to
          St. Luke is the view that he has written cc. i, ii, while knowing
          of the Virgin Birth. We have to remember that not only is the
          Virgin Birth itself a stupendous thought, but that, if known to St.
          Luke, it cannot have been known long, and must therefore have
          preserved the freshness of its wonder. Can we, then, suppose that,
          while under the sway of a presupposition so despotic as this, he
          would straightway proceed to use such expressions as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the parents”</span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“his
          parents”</span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“his father and his
          mother”</span>; that, without qualification, he would speak of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“their purification”</span>; that he would
          represent them astonished at the words of Simeon, and mystified by
          the bearing and speech of Jesus at Jerusalem? Is it credible, in
          short, that he should have fallen into the very ambiguities and
          inconsistencies, which presumably he would be anxious to avoid, and
          which without the slightest difficulty he could have avoided? Even
          if we should still hesitate to answer these questions in the
          negative, our conclusion, that originally the Gospel lacked the
          references to the Virgin Birth which we now find in it, leaves us
          no other option.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It should be
          observed that the arguments we have employed in the present chapter
          do not compel us to take the view that St. Luke never at any time
          taught the Virgin Birth. They are satisfied if we can suppose that
          he had no knowledge of the doctrine when Lk. i, ii was first
          written. To say that i. 34 f. is a correction, inserted by a
          redactor or reader, whose name we do not know, but who is not St.
          Luke, is to take two steps where we have ground for one only. All
          that our study entitles us to claim is that the Virgin Birth
          belongs to a later stratum in the Third Gospel. More than this we
          cannot say, until we have made a thorough linguistic and textual
          examination of Lk. i. 34 f., and this must be our next task.</p>

        Birth</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While, in the
        preceding chapter, we concluded that the Virgin Birth is a later
        stratum in the Third Gospel, we were unable to say to whose hand its
        presence is due. There was nothing to show that St. Luke could never
        at any time have known of the doctrine, but only that he could not
        have known of it at the time when he first drafted and wrote his
        Gospel. We are free, then, to make a new beginning, and to ask:
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Did St.
        Luke teach the Virgin Birth?</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question is
        most conveniently treated by discussing the authorship of Lk. i. 34
        f. As we have seen, this is the crucial passage. If we can believe
        St. Luke himself to have written these verses, we must also attribute
        to his pen the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“as was
        supposed”</span> in iii. 23; in a word, we must conclude that he
        taught the Virgin Birth of Jesus, and we must leave the question, how
        this result is to be co-ordinated with those reached in the previous
        chapter, to be considered later.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That St. Luke and
        no other did write these verses, is the considered view of the
        present writer. There are two lines of argument which converge in
        this direction. The first argument is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">textual</span></em>,
        but it is more than a matter of weighing documents; the second is
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">linguistic</span></em> and stylistic. Neither is
        completely conclusive in itself, and, when taken together, they do
        not admit of a result so stringent as rigid demonstration. They are
        complementary each to the other. Either would be weakened in force in
        the absence of the other, but their agreement is sufficient to
        establish a result for which a very high degree of probability can
        justly be claimed.</p>

          passage is practically complete. The sole exception, which only
          serves to throw into relief the overwhelming mass of positive
          evidence, is found in the Old Latin MS. known as b, which

          and there are probably very many scholars who would still take this
          view. But within recent years a change has come to be discernible
          among leading theological writers on the general question of
          attestation. Much more than in former times it is now recognized
          that during the first half of the second century the text of the
          New Testament, and especially that of the Gospels, was subject to
          rather free handling, and the possibility has to be faced that
          interpolations may have crept into the text in places where
          formerly the external attestation would have been thought
          sufficiently strong.</p>

          the danger of textual corruption to which the New Testament
          writings were exposed to a threefold cause, (i) the material upon
          which the autographs were written, (ii) the employment of
          non-professional scribes, (iii) the fact that the thought of the
          need of absolute verbal reproduction was strange to early scribes.
          The last named fact led, not only to attempts to improve the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In view of this
          position, it is important to ask whether interpolations may not
          exist which have left no trace whatever of their origin in the
          abundant documentary evidence we possess. A representative
          statement of this view may be found in the words of Dr. James
          Moffatt (INT., p. 36 f.): <span class="tei tei-q">“Even where the
          extant text does not suggest any break, the possibility of
          interpolations cannot be denied outright; the distance between the
          oldest MSS., or even the oldest versions, and the date of
          composition leaves ample room for changes to have taken place in
          the interval between the autograph and the earliest known
          text”</span> (p. 38). <span class="tei tei-q">“The extent of
          interpolations varied from a word or two to a paragraph, and the
          motives for it varied equally from sinister to naïve”</span> (p.
          38).<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href=
          "#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One argument in
          favour of this view may be drawn from the state of the existing
          MSS. and versions. The multitudinous variations which occur in
          these documents cannot be explained without admitting the free
          treatment which has been mentioned, and which was natural at a time
          when the Gospels were not yet looked upon as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sacred books”</span>. In large measure such additions
          as we find were drawn from floating Christian tradition, and in
          many cases, e.g. the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pericope
          adulteriae</span></span>, they probably reflect historic
          fact.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href=
          "#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a>
          Nevertheless, they are not genuine parts of the New Testament. The
          further argument is an inference: if such variations from such
          causes occur in the MSS. and versions we possess, may there not be
          interpolations of which we have no external indication in the
          existing texts?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stated in this
          way the question invites an affirmative answer, but there are other
          factors which have yet to be considered. As <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a matter of fact, there is little
          profit in a broad and general discussion. We touch the heart of the
          problem only when we consider the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">types</span></em>
          or classes into which such insertions might conceivably fall. On
          the whole it is best, even if only for purposes of argument, to
          admit the possibility that insertions unmarked by signs of textual
          variation exist, and to ask: Of what character may we suppose these
          insertions to be, and can we define any limits within which they
          are more probable than others? In particular, is Lk. i. 34 f. a
          likely or probable instance? It is obvious that hard and fast lines
          cannot be drawn in individual cases. Nevertheless, it ought to be
          possible to say whether or not a passage like the one we are
          considering is, or is not, the work of a redactor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those instances
          of insertions, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">where textual variations can be
          cited</span></em>, supply us with the safest criterion for other
          suspected cases. Of these instances many, as we have seen, were
          drawn from the floating tradition of the Christian communities. An
          interesting case is suggested by Dr. J. H. Moulton (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">From Egyptian Rubbish
          Heaps</span></span>, p. 101 f.). He traces the saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
          do”</span>, to the reminiscences of the centurion who was present
          at the death of Jesus. <span class="tei tei-q">“The words are not
          in Luke's original Gospel, but as the great Professor Hort said in
          regard to the fact that these words cannot be textually defended,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Few if any words in all the Gospels bear
          more intrinsic witness to the truth of what they relate than
          these’</span> ”</span> (p. 103). On general grounds, it may very
          well be, that similar items of tradition have found their way into
          the existing texts, leaving the surface of the textual stream
          unruffled. But it is clear that, in any suspected case, the
          insertion could be the act of the author himself and not the
          reader. If the latter really is the case, the insertion must have
          been made very early, and must have been of such a kind as not to
          awaken comment or dissent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A second kind of
          insertions may possibly be found in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">explanatory words
          or phrases</span></em>, introduced with the intention of bringing
          out the original writer's meaning. We may take as an instance Rom.
          iv. 1 (<span class="tei tei-q">“What then shall we say that
          Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, hath found?”</span>
          εὐρηκέναι), where Sanday and Headlam say that they <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“regard the omission of εὐρηκέναι as probable with WH.
          text Tr. RV. marg.”</span> (ICC., <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Rom., p. 99).<a id="noteref_46" name=
          "noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> In
          this case, however, as in so many others, the gloss, if gloss it
          is, is reflected in the textual evidence. Nevertheless, the
          possibility may be allowed, that such glosses exist even where
          variants cannot be cited. In these cases, however, it is clear that
          the insertions must have been very early and very happy, and that
          in specific cases their presence can rarely be conceded with
          complete confidence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet another
          class of interpolations may possibly be found in certain passages
          in the Gospels which later conditions obtaining within the
          Christian Church have shaped. That later experience did interpret
          the words of Jesus and give the sense of them in its own terms,
          need not be questioned. But it should always be remembered that in
          any suspected case, the process may well have been complete by the
          time that the Evangelists wrote, and that the passage is not an
          interpolation at all. There are very good grounds for this opinion
          even in cases in which variations in rendering can be cited from
          patristic and other sources, as, for example, in the case of the
          Great Commission in Mt. xxviii. 19. This fact makes it all the more
          difficult to concede an interpolation where the textual record is
          unbroken, though again the possibility that such cases do exist may
          well be left open.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cases just
          considered help us when we come to think of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">doctrinal
          modifications</span></em>. As regards these, it is important to
          draw again a distinction which has been already made. We must
          distinguish, on the one hand, between those instances of doctrinal
          modification that are due to the Evangelists themselves, and which
          are in no sense interpolations, and, on the other hand, those which
          may subsequently have been made by later scribes or readers. Cases
          of the former kind unquestionably occur in the Gospels. We have
          only to examine the way in which the First and Third Evangelists
          have treated the Second Gospel, which lay before them, to be
          assured of this. Alterations, e.g., are made out of a sense of
          reverence for the person of Jesus (cf. Allen, ICC., St. Mt., p.
          xxxi f.). Mt. xix. 17 (<span class="tei tei-q">“Why askest thou me
          concerning that which is good?”</span>), and the changes which
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name=
          "Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Mk. vi. 5 f. has
          been subjected to, both in Mt. and Lk., will serve as
          illustrations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Modifications of
          this kind are not, however, the sort we have specially in mind. It
          is the second type, those which are interpolations proper, that we
          have particularly to consider. The existence of these has frankly
          to be admitted. It is beyond question that doctrinal insertions
          were introduced into the text of the Gospels by later scribes and
          readers. The one case of Mt. i. 16 is proof positive of this (see
          pp. 105 ff.). If the opinion, that the original ending of our
          Second Gospel was deliberately suppressed, is correct, Mk. xvi.
          9-20 may be cited as another instance.<a id="noteref_47" name=
          "noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> An
          important qualification, however, requires to be made. In the two
          cases mentioned there is a conflict of textual evidence, and, as
          regards the latter, the objections are reinforced by the internal
          evidence, arising from the vocabulary, the style, and the
          subject-matter. The present writer must needs conclude that
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          presence of textual variation is an almost necessary condition in
          the case of a doctrinal insertion</span></span>. It is more
          difficult to say how far this requirement should be pressed in the
          other types of interpolation which have been mentioned, but as
          regards doctrinal modifications the test is thoroughly legitimate.
          Without going so far as to pronounce it absolutely impossible, we
          may say that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the theory, that doctrinal insertions may
          exist where the extant texts show no break, is improbable in the
          extreme</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In taking this
          view, we are not confined to the plea of the early and abundant
          nature of textual evidence, or to the effect of controversy in
          preserving the purity of the text, though these are arguments of
          very great weight. A sufficiently decisive factor is <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the character of the
          existing textual variants</span></span>.<a id="noteref_48" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          authentic items of Jesus-tradition and <span class=

          "tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> have not been able to enter the textual
          stream unnoticed, can we suppose that doctrinal modifications have
          breasted the waters without leaving so much as a ripple? If even an
          insertion like <span class="tei tei-q">“Father, forgive them; for
          they know not what they do”</span> has not been able successfully
          to conceal itself, can we believe Lk. i. 34 f. to have succeeded in
          doing this? Can we think that, like Melchizedek, the passage is
          without father, mother, genealogy and beginning of life? In asking
          these questions we need to recall the character of the section. It
          is such as radically to transform the standpoint of the chapters in
          which it occurs. It speaks of matters which, for a considerable
          time at least, were not known among the mass of Christian
          believers, and were never accepted by some. To suppose, then, that
          it is a non-Lukan doctrinal interpolation, is a flight of faith,
          for which those who can make it should receive the credit that is
          due, but of which the present writer must confess that he is not
          capable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While, however,
          we conclude that the theory we are discussing is manifestly
          improbable, we have admitted our inability to pronounce it
          impossible in any shape and form. Provided we agree that the Third
          Gospel never circulated without Lk. i. 34 f., there is one point
          where the passage might have entered as an insertion, and that is
          in the interval before circulation. But even here it is difficult
          to suppose that the passage was added by some one other than St.
          Luke himself. In our entire ignorance of the circumstances under
          which the Gospel came to have a wider circulation, we cannot say
          that this supposition is inadmissible. It has a bare possibility in
          its favour, but not more. If a linguistic examination of the
          passage gave a result unfavourable to Lukan authorship, the
          possibility would become more significant. But if the contrary
          proves to be the case, then it becomes so remote as to be unworthy
          of serious consideration. It is because of this position that we
          have described the present argument as being not completely
          conclusive in itself, and the one line of reasoning as
          complementary to the other. Quite apart, however, from the
          linguistic argument, the difficulties which the theory of non-Lukan
          interpolation has to face on textual grounds are formidable.</p>

          affirmed that any hypothesis of interpolation, which does not take
          account of the linguistic characteristics of the passage, is
          premature; indeed, it may easily turn out to be a rather glaring

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is precisely
          the linguistic test which we miss in the arguments of those who
          claim that Lk. i. 34 f. was not written by St. Luke. Usually it is
          thought enough to argue an incompatibility between this passage and
          its context, and straightway to assign the former to the pen of an
          unknown redactor. We may illustrate this method from the two
          articles in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Encyclopaedia Biblica</span></span> to which
          reference has been made. In the article on <span class=

          "tei tei-q">“It has to be pointed out that even in Lk. i only two
          verses—vv. 34 f.—contain the idea of the virgin birth clearly and
          effectively; and these disturb the connexion so manifestly that we
          are compelled to regard them as a later insertion”</span>. The only
          argument of a linguistic character is the remark: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Note, further, that apart from i. 34 ἐπεί
          (<span class="tei tei-q">‘since’</span>) is not met with either in

          <span class="tei tei-q">“To Joh. Hillmann (JPT. 17, 221 ff.)
          belongs the merit of having conclusively shown that the two verses

          supernatural birth of Jesus of the Virgin Mary is stated, are
          incompatible with the entire representation of the rest of chaps, i
          and ii, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          theories of this kind that we have in view when we say (p. 47) that
          to state such a conclusion is to take two steps where there is
          ground for one only.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The importance
          of the linguistic argument is manifest in such works as Sir John C.
          Hawkins's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Horae Synopticae</span></span> (2nd ed., 1909)

          (1882). It has also received great emphasis in the books in which

          the Acts, viz. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may not be
          without value to ask how far the linguistic argument can take us.
          We may certainly lay down the broad proposition that arguments in
          favour of an interpolation ought to be supported by the linguistic
          facts; provided, of course, that the suspected passage is
          susceptible of the linguistic test. We do not forget that a passage
          may be of such a neutral character as not to admit of that test. In
          that case we have to be content with other available arguments.
          Where, however, the linguistic test can be applied, and where the
          result is strongly favourable to the genuineness of the passage,
          that, assuredly, is a very serious objection for the theory of
          interpolation to face. It becomes especially formidable, if we can
          bring forward no evidence to prove an anachronism, or if we can
          allege no real textual objections. Under such circumstances,
          indeed, we may well adopt the rule that, in cases of this kind, we
          have not to do with the insertion of a redactor; unless, of course,
          we have good reason for saying that the interpolator has entered
          deeply into the original writer's style. The view here taken does
          not mean that all objections to a passage are sufficiently met if
          we can state a strong linguistic case on the other side. We shall
          have reason to take up this point again (p. 69). For the present it
          is sufficient to say that each kind of argument must be given its
          own particular force. In the case of a passage where objections
          arising from context and subject-matter cannot be gainsaid, we must
          conclude that the passage is of later date than its context, but
          not more. In a case where the facts of vocabulary, style, and
          subject-matter are sufficiently favourable, and no textual
          difficulties forbid, we must ascribe the passage to the original
          writer. In a case, finally, where both kinds of conditions occur,
          we must suppose that the passage was afterwards inserted by the
          writer himself into the body of his own work. Clearly, then, the
          linguistic examination of a suspected passage is a matter of great
          importance. In the case of Lk. i. 34 f., it is not too much to say
          that it is a task as necessary as it is neglected.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
          objected that the passage is one of two verses only, and that, in
          consequence, it is much too brief to allow of satisfactory
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name=
          "Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> results. On the
          other hand, it should be remembered that the thirty-seven words of
          the section include several interesting phrases and points of
          construction, which are so important in matters of this kind.
          Moreover, in the case of St. Luke, we are dealing with a writer who
          has a very distinctive style.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50"
          href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Harnack has
          recognized the force of the linguistic argument in the case of two
          verses (thirty-one words). These are the last two verses of the
          Acts. After remarking that, so far as he knows, it has never been
          questioned that these words come from the author of the complete
          work, though they have the appearance of being a postscript, he
          continues: <span class="tei tei-q">“Moreover, in content and in
          form they agree so closely with the Lukan style that from this
          point of view strong arguments can be produced in favour of their
          genuineness”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Date of Acts</span></span>, &amp;c., p. 94).
          In a footnote he adds the linguistic argument. This is quite enough
          for our purpose. It is true that the genuineness of Lk. i. 34 f. is
          questioned by many (on other than linguistic and textual grounds).
          Nevertheless, the field is open for inquiry as to whether
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in content and form they agree so closely
          with the Lukan style that from this point of view strong arguments
          can be produced in favour of their genuineness”</span>. After all,
          the length of the passage is not the vital consideration, but its
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">character</span></em> (which may, or may not,
          be more striking than that of a much longer section); and this is
          something which can come out only after actual examination.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We turn, then,
          to the linguistic examination of Lk. i. 34 f. According to the
          Westcott and Hort text, the passage is as follows:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">34. εἶπεν δὲ
          Μαριὰμ πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον Πῶς ἔσται τοῦτο, ἐπεὶ ἄνδρα οὐ γινώσκω; 35.

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every one of
            these words and phrases is well represented in the Lukan
            writings, and in the case of some of them we get, on
            investigation, remarkable results.<a id="noteref_52" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Take the case
            of ἀνήρ. In the NT. it occurs 212 times, and of these no less
            than 125 appear in St. Luke's works (26 in G. and 99 in Acts),
            i.e. 58 per cent. Still more remarkable is the result when we
            compare ἀνήρ and ἄνθρωπος. Whereas the other Evangelists use
            ἄνθρωπος very frequently indeed (218 times), they employ ἀνήρ
            only 20 times. St. Luke also (especially in the Gospel) uses
            ἄνθρωπος frequently (93 times), but he has ἀνήρ 26 times (cf. Mt.
            8 times, Mk. 4 times, Jn. 8 times). If we take both Lukan
            writings, the usage of ἄνθρωπος and ἀνήρ is roughly equal,
            whereas in the rest of the NT. it is as 9 is to 2. We can say,
            therefore, that St. Luke shows a liking for ἀνήρ, whereas Mt. Mk.
            and Jn. markedly prefer ἄνθρωπος. However, the word is so common
            that we can lay no stress on the fact that it occurs in i. 34,
            where the connexion demands it. We can only note its congruity
            with a Lukan liking.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Καὶ ἀποκριθείς
            is also interesting, though not, of course, in any way decisive.
            In Lk. the phrase occurs 14 times; in Mt. it is found 6 times; in
            Mk. 8; never in the Fourth Gospel, and never in the Acts. It
            occurs, that is to say, in those parts of the New Testament in
            which sources, probably Aramaic,<a id="noteref_53" name=

            employed. This is in line with the view expressed by Moulton and
            Milligan with regard to the aorist passive forms of the
            verb.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href=

            say that they incline to the opinion that ἀπεκρίθην <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“belongs only to early Hellenistic, whence it was
            taken by the LXX translators to render a common Hebrew phrase,
            passing thence into the narrative parts of NT. as a definite
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘Septuagintalism’</span> ”</span>. It is
            in keeping with this view that καὶ ἀποκριθείς ... εἶπεν should
            appear in that part of St. Luke's Gospel where most of all we
            have reason to posit Semitic sources, whether oral or
            documentary. As we have seen, half the record of this expression
            in the New Testament, apart from Lk. i. 35, is in the Third
            Gospel. The presence, then, of καὶ ἀποκριθείς in Lk. i. 35 is
            congruous with these facts; more, perhaps, we cannot say.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Μαριάμ (of the
            mother of Jesus) occurs more often in Lk. than in other NT.
            writers (9 times and probably 10 in the G., once in Acts); the
            form Μαρία appears but once (ii. 19 is doubtful). In Mk. Μαρία
            occurs once, Μαριάμ never; in Mt. we find Μαρία 3 times and
            Μαριάμ probably twice. The use of the form Μαριάμ in i. 34 is
            therefore in agreement with St. Luke's usage, but of course this
            does not preclude the hand of an interpolator, since every
            instance of Μαριάμ (of the mother of Jesus) in the Third Gospel
            occurs in the first two chapters.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As is well
            known, the phrase Πνεῦμα ἅγιον is very frequently found in the
            Lukan writings. The percentage is as much as 60, and out of the
            instances in the NT., where the phrase is anarthrous, more than
            50 per cent, are in St. Luke (G. and Acts). The phrase is
            therefore very strongly Lukan. But perhaps we ought not to
            include the phrase among those which tell strongly against the
            theory of interpolation, since a redactor would easily and
            naturally introduce it in the connexion in which it appears in i.
            35. <span class="tei tei-q">“The new view was not an intruder
            from the sphere of heathen mythology, but a logical conclusion
            from the belief that our Lord was <span class=

            144). We can say therefore that Πνεῦμα ἅγιον is admirably in
            keeping with Lukan usage but hardly more. The case is quite
            otherwise with the whole phrase, Πνεῦμα ἅγ. ἐπελεύσεται ἐπὶ σέ,
            as we shall see.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Καλέω is also
            a word which might be considered here, for it is, of course, a
            very common word. Having regard, however, to the way in which it
            is used, it will be better to take it later.</p>

            words which present difficulties, less or greater, on the

            and perhaps τὸ γεννώμενον.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. We
            introduce τὸ γεννώμενον here, because the expression, as distinct
            from the construction, occurs nowhere else in Lk. As a matter of
            fact it occurs nowhere else in the New Testament in this form.
            The perfect passive participle, however, appears twice in the
            Johannine writings: τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τ. σαρκὸς σάρξ ἐστιν (Jn.
            iii. 6), and ὅτι πᾶν γεγεννημένον ἐκ τ. θεοῦ νικᾷ τ. κόσμον (1
            Jn. v. 4). What is more important is that there is a close
            parallel to τὸ γεννώμενον in Mt. i. 30, which reads, τὸ γὰρ ἐν
            αὐτῇ γεννηθὲν ἐκ πνεύματος ἐστιν ἁγίου. The complete clause in
            Lk. runs, διὸ καὶ τὸ γεννώμενον ἅγιον κληθήσεται, υἱὸς θεοῦ.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
            certainly open to any one to argue that the passage in Lk. is
            introduced by an interpolator who is under the influence of Mt.
            i. 20. Why, however, while under that influence, he should so far
            enter into Lukan usage as to introduce the Lukan διὸ καί, and
            κληθήσεται, to say nothing of putting Πνεῦμα ἅγιον into a
            different connexion in a characteristically Lukan phrase (Π. ἅγ.
            ἐπελεύσεται ἐπὶ σέ. Cf. Acts i. 8 and see later), are questions
            which it is not easy to answer. Assuredly there is not much here
            to support the hypothesis of interpolation, and when we consider
            the constructional use of the article with the participle, there
            is still less, if indeed anything at all. To consider τὸ
            γεννώμενον is rather a concession to carefulness than the
            acknowledgement of a real difficulty.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. Γινώσκω
            must be examined, because in i. 34 it is used of knowledge in the
            way of marital relationship. The only parallel in the New
            Testament is Mt. i. 25, where, however, it is used of a man: καὶ
            οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν αὐτὴν ἕως οὖ ἕτεκεν υἱόν. On the other hand, in
            other senses, γινώσκω occurs fairly frequently in Lk. It is,
            however, in no sense Lukan, being distributed evenly throughout
            the New Testament, except in the Johannine writings, where it is
            very common.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We cannot,
            therefore, produce evidence to show that elsewhere St. Luke uses
            γ. in the special sense of i. 34. Nevertheless, there is no
            reason why he should not have written γ. in that passage, and
            there are considerations which go to show how he could easily
            have used the word.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In i. 34 and

            it is probable that the influence of the Septuagint is to be
            found in both passages. In the LXX there are several instances of
            γ. used, as in i. 34, of a woman. It is so used in Gen. xix. 8
            (of Lot's daughters), in Judg. xi. 39 (of Jephthah's daughter),
            and in Num. xxxi. 17 (of the women of Midian). If, then, we are
            right in tracing the influence of the LXX, in i. 34, we have
            ground for finding the hand of St. Luke in that passage, even
            though he never again uses γ. in that sense. For it is just in
            Lk. i, ii that the influence of the LXX is most marked.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even if we do

            is not at all apparent why St. Luke himself should not have used
            the word. And if the argument in favour of the theory of
            interpolation is to be sustained, it is scarcely enough to urge
            the bare fact that St. Luke does not use γ. as in i. 34
            elsewhere. An idiom which occurs in Greek writers from the time
            of Menander<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href=
            "#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 325) may well have
            been known to a writer like St. Luke, apart from its presence in
            the Septuagint. If verses 34, 35 are indeed Lukan, it is quite
            probable that in γ. we should find the influence of the
            Septuagint, but we are not at all shut up to Septuagint usage. In
            the connexion in which it occurs γινώσκω was a suitable word to
            employ, and its presence there is in no way incongruous with
            Lukan authorship.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. In these
            verses the word which is of greatest difficulty is without doubt
            ἐπεί. In the rest of the New Testament it occurs 25 times. Of
            these 10 are found in the Pauline Epistles and 9 in the Epistle
            to the Hebrews. The remaining 6 appear <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> in the Gospels; 3 in Mt., 1 in Mk., and 2
            in Jn. Apart then from i. 34 ἐπεί occurs nowhere in St. Luke's
            works.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are, it
            is true, two Lukan passages, one in the Gospel (vii. 1) and the
            other in the Acts (xiii. 46), where ἐπεί δέ occurs in some MSS.
            The true reading, however, in both cases is probably
            ἐπειδή.<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href=
            "#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> We
            have, therefore, to face the fact, that not only is ἐπεί found
            nowhere else in St. Luke's works, but that elsewhere he seems to
            prefer ἐπειδή and ἐπειδήπερ (the latter in the Prologue to the
            Gospel, and the former five times out of the ten cases in which
            it occurs in the New Testament). Here is the strongest argument,
            which on linguistic grounds can be urged against the genuineness
            of i. 34 f. The richness of St. Luke's vocabulary increases the
            difficulty.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href=
            "#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> Why,
            if he has used ἐπεί in i. 34, he should never employ it again, is
            a question which it is not easy to answer. If, in view of the
            evidence as a whole, the case for an interpolation fails, we
            shall have to content ourselves with the fact, however strange,
            that here and here only έπεί occurs in Lk. A writer indeed may
            use a word once and never again. Ἐπεί occurs but once in Mk. (xv.
            42), and it may be so here. Assuredly, in a linguistic argument
            room must always be left for the occurrence of ἅπαξ λεγόμενα in
            an individual writer. The force of this contention is, however,
            somewhat weakened by the preference which St. Luke seems to show
            for ἐπειδή, and it must be allowed that the case for an
            interpolation does receive support from ἐπεί.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these may
            be added xxi. 36, xxiii. 47, 48. The construction is clearly
            Lukan, without, of course, being exclusively Lukan, and though τὸ
            γεννώμενον does not occur elsewhere in St. Luke's works, the verb
            is not uncommon (10 times out of 93 in the NT., of which 40 occur
            in the Genealogy in Mt.).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. Κληθήσεται.
            In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            underlines this verb, as a Lukan trait, wherever it occurs in the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“We”</span> Sections, which he prints on
            pp. 4-12. Out of the total number of cases in which it occurs in
            the New Testament, no less than 44 per cent. are found in the
            Lukan writings. In the Gospel it is present 41 times. It should
            also be noted that when we compare καὶ τὸ γ. ἅγιον κληθήσεται
            with the analogous phrase in Mt. 1. 20, τὸ γὰρ ἐν αὐτῇ γεννηθὲν
            ἐκ πνεύματός ἐστιν ἁγίου, in the latter the Lukan καλέω is
            absent. Of course καλέω is a common word, but St. Luke's use of
            it is distinctive, and with this usage κληθήσεται in verse 35
            agrees.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. We have
            referred to δύναμις already,<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63"
            href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> and
            have said that while frequent in Lk., it is too common a word to
            be important for our present purpose. The case is otherwise with
            the phrase δύναμις Ὑψίστου. St. Luke is fond of using δ. in
            composition with other words in the genitive. In his Gospel, he
            employs <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg
            065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            it with τὸ πνεῦμα, ὁ θεός, Κύριος, οἱ οὐρανοί, and ὁ ἐχθρός. In
            the Acts (viii. 10) we have ἡ Δύναμις τ. θεοῦ ἡ καλουμένη Μεγάλη.
            In Mt. we find this usage twice; in Mk. once; in the main
            epistles of St. Paul it occurs 13 times; elsewhere in the New
            Testament 7 times. That is to say, out of 29 instances in the New
            Testament (other than i. 35),<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64"
            href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> St.
            Luke has 6 (or 20 per cent.). We may therefore say that this
            again is a marked characteristic of St. Luke's usage, and though
            the phrase δ. Ὕ. does not occur again in Lk. (it occurs nowhere
            else in the NT.), it is thoroughly congruous with the Lukan
            style. We have also to note the word Ὕψιστος. Out of 12 instances
            in the New Testament St. Luke actually has 8, or 75 per cent. As,
            however, three of these occur in chaps. i and ii, it might be
            argued that the interpolator has introduced Ὕ. in verse 35 under
            the influence of these very chapters. That, however, he should
            combine it with δ. is interesting. Indeed, on the theory of
            interpolation, our interpolator has combined a distinctively
            Lukan word (Ὕψιστος) with another word (δύναμις) which St. Luke
            often uses (24 times), to produce a characteristic Lukan phrase
            (δ. in composition with a noun in the genitive)!</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. Διὸ καί.
            Elsewhere St. Luke uses διό 9 times (once in the Gospel and 8
            times in the Acts). In this respect he may be compared with St.
            Paul, who uses the word 25 times, and the author of the Epistle
            to the Hebrews, who employs it 8 times. In the Catholic Epistles
            it appears 6 times. There is but one instance in Mt. and a
            doubtful case in Mk. The results are also interesting when we
            take διὸ καί. Out of 10 instances in the New Testament, St. Luke
            has 2 (Ac. x. 29 and xxiv. 26), St. Paul has 6, and Hebrews 2.
            There is not an instance in Mt. or Mk., or anywhere else in the
            New Testament. We are far from suggesting that no one else could
            use διὸ καί.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href=
            "#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> The
            point is that the supposed interpolator has introduced the phrase
            into the work of a writer who, with St. Paul and the author of
            Hebrews, alone among New Testament writers employs it!</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. Ἐπισκιάσει
            σοι. Ἐπισκιάζω appears in four other places in the New Testament.
            Of these, three are connected with the <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> story of the Transfiguration (Mt. xvii. 5,
            Mk. ix. 7, Lk. ix. 34). That the remaining instance should be
            Acts v. 15 is, in connexion with our present problem, an
            interesting fact. Thayer-Grimm remarks that the verb occurs in
            <span class="tei tei-q">“profane”</span> authors, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“generally with an accusative of the object, and in
            the sense of obscuring”</span>. In the Septuagint, however, it is
            used of the divine covering or overshadowing (cf. Ps. xc. (xci.)
            4; Ps. cxxxix. (cxl.) 8; Ex. xl. 29 (35)). We have to ask whether
            these passages, especially the last, have influenced the writer
            of i. 35. We cannot assume the point, of course, but there is
            much to be said for it. The thought of the cloud of Yahweh
            overshadowing the tent of meeting may very well have shaped the
            thought and the phrasing of δ. Ὕψίστου ἐπισκιάσει σοι. If there
            is any weight in this suggestion (cf. Plummer, op. cit., p. 24),
            again it tells for Lukan authorship—so far, that is to say, as
            the undoubted fact that chaps. i and ii have a distinctly Old
            Testament atmosphere will take us. Apart, however, from such
            considerations it is a remarkable fact, on the theory of
            interpolation, that a word so rare in the New Testament, and one
            which St. Luke uses more than any one else, should appear in the
            suspected verses. Acts v. 15 (ἵνα ἐρχομένου Πέτρου κἂν ἡ σκιὰ
            ἐπισκιάσει τινὶ αὐτῶν) is enough in itself to raise the gravest
            doubt that we have here to do with an interpolator.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">6. Πνεῦμα
            ἅγιον ἐπελεύσεται ἐπὶ σέ. Here we have first to call attention to
            the verb ἐπέρχομαι. Apart from Eph. ii. 7 and James v. 1, this
            verb is limited to the Lukan writings, where it occurs six times
            (i.e. besides i. 35). We have already spoken of Πνεῦμα ἅγιον and
            remarked that, while it is characteristic of St. Luke, we could
            not lay stress upon that fact, since even an interpolator would
            naturally introduce a reference to the Holy Spirit in such a
            connexion as i. 35. If, however, as now we take the whole phrase,
            we come to a very different conclusion. For in Acts i. 8 we have
            the significantly close parallel, ἐπελθόντος τ. ἁγίου πνεύματος
            ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς. The parallel speaks for itself!</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A possible
            reply to the linguistic argument presented above is that we may
            have to do with an interpolator who has thoroughly entered into
            the Lukan style. If our examination has shown anything at all, it
            has shown that Lk. i. 34. f. is very far from presenting neutral
            features: it is shot through and through with <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Lukanisms”</span>.<a id="noteref_67" name=
            "noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a> But,
            it may be asked, could not an interpolator, strongly influenced
            by the Lukan style, have penned these verses?</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us see
            what, on that hypothesis, the interpolator has done. He has
            produced a passage of thirty-seven words, in which there
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name=
            "Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is not a
            construction, and only one word (ἐπεί), which is not well
            represented in the Lukan writings. He has used a word (γινώσκω)
            in a sense not elsewhere illustrated in those works, but a word
            which St. Luke would naturally employ in the connexion in which
            it occurs. He has employed words, phrases, and constructions for
            which St. Luke has a fondness, such as καλέω, δύναμις Ὕψίστου,
            διὸ καί, the article with the participle in place of a noun (τὸ
            γενν.).<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href=
            "#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a> He
            has used two verbs (ἐπισκιάζω and ἐπέρχομαι) which are rare in
            the New Testament, but which St. Luke uses more than once; the
            phrase Π. ἅ. ἐπελεύσεται ἐπὶ σέ, which is closely paralleled in
            Acts i. 8; and, above all, the markedly Lukan εἶπεν δὲ ...
            πρός.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This feat, it
            must be confessed, is a striking performance. If, indeed, it has
            been achieved, we must conclude that it has been carried out
            deliberately. We make every allowance for the possibility that a
            redactor may well enter into the style of an author. But to
            suppose that in so short a passage so many Lukan features have
            come together without premeditation or design is all but
            impossible. We make bold to say that, if we must admit such an
            undesigned collocation of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Lukanisms”</span>, we can have little confidence in
            the linguistic argument anywhere.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But can we
            believe that the linguistic features of Lk. i. 34 f. have been
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">purposely</span></em> introduced? Such a
            question is its own answer. No one, assuredly, would resort to
            the desperate expedient of supposing a redactor, who laboriously
            amasses Lukan characteristics, with the intention of passing off
            the very phraseology of his insertion as genuine. A modern
            interpolator might work along these lines, but not an ancient
            redactor. Interpolations are not forgeries. The thought of
            consciously reproducing stylistic features in an insertion would
            probably never have occurred to a redactor of the Gospels.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far then as
            linguistic considerations go, we must conclude that our unknown
            interpolator is a mythical personage. We do <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id=
            "Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not forget the difficulty of
            ἐπεί, but if Lk. i. 34 f. is a non-Lukan interpolation, we must
            have more support than this. Warp and woof are Lukan; only a
            single thread gives cause for hesitation. Must not this
            hesitation give way when we look at the facts as a whole? Can we
            strain out the gnat, and swallow the camel? Assuredly on
            linguistic grounds the most reasonable conclusion we can frame is
            that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Lk. i. 34 f. comes from the hand of St. Luke

          Conclusion</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now to
          co-ordinate our results. However strong a linguistic argument may
          be, there is perhaps always room for the view that it is
          confirmatory rather than demonstrative. In the present case also,
          the shortness of the passage can be pleaded. In noticing this
          objection we urged that the character of the passage is the
          relevant consideration, and we think Lk. i. 34 f. meets this
          demand. But we have no need to press the linguistic argument to the
          extent we ourselves believe to be legitimate, when we find that
          both this argument and the textual argument point steadily in the
          same direction. It is this fact, that both arguments converge on
          the same point, which is the ultimate ground for our conclusion.
          Short of supplying a rigid demonstration, which should not be
          sought, it is sufficient to establish for us the Lukan authorship
          of Lk. i. 34 f.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This view
          carries with it at once the further conclusion that at some time or
          other St. Luke taught and believed in the Virgin Birth. But before
          we can rest satisfied with this result, we need to look more
          closely at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">an alternative form of the
          interpolation-hypothesis</span></span>, to which reference has
          already been made (p. 36). This is the view of Kattenbusch, Merx,
          Weinel, and J. M. Thompson (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Miracles in the New Testament</span></span>,
          p. 149).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
          this theory the interpolation consists in the phrase ἐπεὶ ἄνδρα οὐ
          γινώσκω, an insertion which, it is contended, has transformed the
          promise of a natural conception into the prophecy of a virgin
          birth. Mr. Thompson notices the two forms which the theory may
          assume. The insertion may be either <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          modification of St. Luke's source, introduced by the Evangelist
          himself, as editor”</span>, or it may be <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          later addition to the text of Lk. by some person or congregation
          who wished to make the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg
          070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          miracle quite clear”</span> (p. 149). It is obvious that, in its
          former shape, this hypothesis would not seriously affect our
          results reached thus far, provided we could agree that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“verse 35 is not inconsistent with human
          parentage”</span> (Thompson, p. 148), and is best interpreted in
          this way. As regards the second form of the theory, the case is
          different. If ἐπεὶ ἄνδρα οὐ γινώσκω is the addition of a later
          reader or congregation, it is much more difficult to think that St.
          Luke taught the Virgin Birth. It would not be impossible; but it
          would leave the whole problem to rest upon the interpretation of
          verse 35.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are unable to
          accept the theory that ἐπεὶ ἄνδρα οὐ γινώσκω is an insertion of
          unknown origin, for the following reasons:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On the whole, the
          more natural interpretation of verse 35 is that in itself it
          implies the Virgin Birth.</span></span> It is easier, on this view,
          to explain ἐπελεύσεται and ἐπισκιάσει followed by διὸ καί. (Cf.
          Schmiedel, col. 2957 n.; Plummer, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">St.
          Lk.</span></span>, p. 24f.; Lobstein, op. cit., p. 67.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">No textual evidence
          can be cited in support of the theory.</span></span> This is
          frankly admitted by Mr. Thompson, and the insertion is explained as
          an editorial modification. We could regard this explanation as
          sufficient, if the <span class="tei tei-q">“insertion”</span> could
          be looked upon as an <span class="tei tei-q">“explanatory
          phrase”</span>, intended to sharpen a reference to the Virgin
          Birth, which had already been found in the context. On this reading
          of the problem, absence of textual variation might not be an
          insuperable difficulty. But if we must regard ἐπεὶ ἄνδρα οὐ γινώσκω
          as a doctrinal modification—an attempt on the part of an unknown
          editor to impose upon the narrative a sense quite different from
          that which previously it had been understood to bear—then the
          argument sketched in the first part of the present chapter is
          wholly against the theory. We cannot understand why no echoes of
          the earlier view have lingered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It is difficult to
          suppose that a later reader who sought to work up the original
          narrative in the interests of the Virgin Birth would have exercised
          such restraint.</span></span> To expand a narrative in the
          direction of the sense which it already bears is a conceivable
          suggestion. To transform it totally by merely adding four words is
          a theory which does not carry conviction. Was ever an interpolator
          so ingenious as this?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg
          071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          side may be pleaded (1) the difficulty of ἐπεὶ, (2) many of the
          arguments we have sketched in Chapter II. The difficulty of ἐπεὶ we
          have to admit. As regards the second point, we believe that the
          theory we have yet to outline in the next chapter meets the case
          much better, without suffering from the special objections which
          can be brought against the view we have just discussed. For the
          reasons given we are unable to accept that view. We prefer to
          regard Lk. i. 34 f. as a unity, and to interpret both verses as
          implying the Virgin Birth. And as we have found sufficient reasons,
          both on textual and linguistic grounds, for ascribing the passage
          to St. Luke, we believe that he taught the Virgin Birth.</p>

        Birth In The Third Gospel</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the present
        chapter we must formulate a theory which shall do justice to the
        results obtained in the last two chapters. We have argued that the
        Virgin Birth is not an original element in the Third Gospel, that
        several passages in it are inconsistent with the doctrine, and that
        Lk. i. 34 f. is a later insertion. On the other hand we have given
        reasons for our belief that St. Luke really did write the passage
        just mentioned, and that in consequence he taught the Virgin Birth.
        It is useless, we think, to set these results against one another;
        they are not contradictory. The argument from the linguistic and
        textual facts will not make one iota of difference to those derived
        from the treatment and subject-matter of Lk. i, ii, and the latter
        will not in any way impair the former. Writers who hold fast to the
        view that St. Luke wrote i. 34 f. have not, in that one contention,
        answered their opponents, and critics who plead for the hypothesis of
        non-Lukan interpolation travel much too fast. The final theory must
        take all the facts into account.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far as we
          ourselves are concerned, there is only one hypothesis open to us,
          and it is not far to seek. It will be best if we first state it
          somewhat baldly, leaving obvious difficulties to be considered
          later. The theory is as follows:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
          instance St. Luke wrote his Gospel, either in whole or in part,
          without any knowledge of the Virgin Birth. To him, as to the
          compiler of the Lukan Genealogy, Jesus was the son of Joseph and of
          Mary. St. Luke's estimate of Jesus was not less high than that of
          St. Paul and St. Mark, but, as was probably true in the case of
          each of these writers, no tradition of the Miraculous Birth had
          reached him. He looked upon Jesus as <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Child of Wondrous Promise, and for his
          analogies he turned to the Old Testament to the stories of Isaac
          and of Samuel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In contrast to
          earlier writers St. Luke had an excellent Birth-tradition at his
          disposal. According to his sources the coming and future Messianic
          greatness of Jesus had been divinely foretold. His birth was
          heralded by angelic choirs, and humble shepherds brought their meed
          of worship and of praise. By an insight divinely given, men like
          Simeon and women like Anna saw in Him the child of promise. He was
          to be a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of His
          people Israel. We need not stay to look more closely into the
          story, which doubtless has been worked up as regards its form by
          the Evangelist's hand. Suffice it to say that St. Luke's picture is
          that of a Wondrous Birth, supernaturally foretold; not a virgin
          birth.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href=
          "#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some time after
          he had penned his narrative, possibly after it had been dispatched
          to Theophilus, but at any rate before the Gospel gained a wider
          circulation, St. Luke received the tradition of the Virgin Birth.
          At what time and from what source the story reached him we are
          quite unable to say; possibly it was from some reader or readers to
          whom he had submitted his narrative; possibly the story travelled
          along some independent channel. In any case the probability is that
          the tradition was imparted to St. Luke by some one who claimed to
          possess a fuller and a better account, and whose claim the
          Evangelist respected and admitted. Having regard to St. Luke's
          standing and methods as an historian, we prefer to believe that the
          tradition reached him through a definite and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">personal</span></em> channel, than to suppose
          that of his own initiative he freely altered a valuable source out
          of deference to a growing theory.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The historical
          value of the new information is a question we are not now
          considering. It is part of our theory, however, that it satisfied
          the mind of St. Luke; to him the Virgin Birth was historic fact.
          Probably the story appealed to him at once as a fitting explanation
          of the unique personality of Jesus. It was <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> a tradition rich in doctrinal possibilities;
          it provoked reflection, and it answered questions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Evangelist
          saw at once that the story must find a place in his narrative.
          Fortunately it was not too late, and fortunately again there was a
          point where it could be included without entailing the necessity of
          rewriting cc. i, ii entirely. He had only to insert the words we
          have now in i. 34 f. into the address of the angel, and to add to
          the opening words of the Genealogy the phrase <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“as was supposed”</span>, to obtain a narrative in
          which truths previously unknown to him found sufficient statement.
          If we can suppose that the adaptation of what he had previously
          written was not drastic enough, we obtain a hypothesis which at
          least does justice to every result we have yet secured.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The view that
          Lk. i. 34 f. is an interpolation made by St. Luke himself was put
          forward by Zimmermann in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Studien und Kritiken</span></span> (p. 273 f.)
          in 1903. His treatment (cf. Moffatt, INT., p. 269 n.) differs in
          several respects from that outlined above. Zimmermann posits an
          Aramaic Jewish-Christian source which described a natural birth,
          and suggests that it was in the course of translating this document
          that St. Luke added i. 34 f. The Evangelist is also credited with
          having altered i. 27 and ii. 5, so as to describe Mary as betrothed
          to Joseph. Zimmermann also explains ii. 22 (αὐτῶν) as a
          mistranslation, and ascribes to St. Luke the parenthesis of ii. 35
          a, and the chronology of iii. 1-2, which he holds is
          inaccurate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
          this hypothesis St. Luke must have been acquainted with the Virgin
          Birth <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">before</span></em> he began to translate the
          supposed Aramaic document. This view is encumbered with difficulty;
          for, if Zimmermann is right, we should certainly expect a much more
          drastic editing of the document than can be shown. The extent to
          which this difficulty appears in the case of our own theory is one
          for which we think that justification can be given.<a id=
          "noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a> In the
          case of Zimmermann's hypothesis the obstacle is too great. On this
          view we cannot understand how the Evangelist allowed himself to
          write down those expressions which are incompatible with the
          Miraculous Conception.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The view we have
          preferred agrees with that of Zimmermann <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> in positing a source or sources which
          described a natural birth. It differs from it in denying that the
          Evangelist knew of the Virgin Birth at the time when he made use of
          those sources. We prefer to think that it was after cc. i, ii had
          attained what is substantially its present form in Greek, that St.
          Luke came to hear of the Virgin Birth, and that it was then that he
          inserted i. 34 f. This supposition includes the positive advantages
          of Zimmermann's theory, and it agrees better with the existing
          literary phenomena of Lk. i, ii.<a id="noteref_73" name=

          the Gospels Were Written</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In holding the
          view we have outlined, we have no thought of running with the hare
          and hunting with the hounds. Our theory is not intended as an
          eirenicon. It is not an attempt to make the best of two worlds, the
          critical and the dogmatic. If we appear to have introduced the
          Virgin Birth into the Third Gospel by the back door, after we have
          bowed it out at the front, this is simply because the evidence
          leaves us no alternative. Our theory makes room for the twofold
          fact, as it seems to us, (1) that the Virgin Birth is not an
          original element in the Third Gospel, and (2) that St. Luke wrote
          the one passage in the Gospel which asserts the doctrine; thus for
          us it is inevitable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, from another
          point of view, our hypothesis seems a bold venture, we may justly
          claim that the facts are such as to demand a bold treatment. Nor is
          it a sufficient objection to say that the theory is complex. Life
          is a complex thing, and there are few times when we need to
          remember it so much as when we are thinking of the production of an
          historical work.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apart from other
          claims which can be made, our theory has <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> one important, if general, advantage; it
          takes account of the elementary facts of human composition. Have we
          given sufficient thought to the fact that a writer like St. Luke
          may well have turned back to review, and even to alter, in the
          light of further information, what he had already written? Is not
          this what nearly every one does who writes or relates anything at
          all? Is it not indeed rather a rare than a usual proceeding to
          write a story from start to finish without insertion, omission, and
          revision?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Introduction”</span> Dr. James Moffatt has
          drawn attention to these things, and especially as they concern St.
          Luke's two works. He shows that interpolation may take place
          <span class="tei tei-q">“either (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) at
          the hands of the author himself, or (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) by
          subsequent editors of the volume, after the writer's death, or
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">c</span></span>) by scribes (or editors) of
          the text”</span> (p. 36). Under (a) he refers to instances in
          Aeschylus, Herodotus, Virgil, Juvenal, Martial, and Lucretius.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Several passages in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Rerum
          Natura</span></span> (e.g. ii. 165-83) are also to be explained
          most naturally as additions made by Lucretius himself to the
          original draft, and in the case of the Third Gospel or its sequel
          it is not unlikely that Luke may have re-edited ... his
          work”</span> (p. 37). Dr. Moffatt gives a very interesting modern
          example in the case of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Northanger Abbey</span></span>, which was
          first composed by Jane Austen in 1798. <span class="tei tei-q">“In
          the fifth chapter, however, we have an allusion to Miss Edgeworth's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Belinda</span></span>—a novel which did not
          appear until 1801. This proves that Miss Austen's work lies before
          us in a revised form; the first draft was gone over by the
          authoress before its final publication some years later”</span> (p.
          37).<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href=
          "#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will scarcely
          be denied that the possibility of interpolation by an original
          author has often been overlooked by many critics. They are not slow
          to find the insertions of later readers and scribes, but often it
          seems tacitly to be assumed that the original writers must have
          written with logical and almost unerring precision. Curiously
          enough, something like the Verbal Inspiration of Scripture is
          required to justify some of the critical results reached. This is a
          doctrine long since discredited, but being <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> dead it yet speaks. It will have to be
          allowed, we think, that mechanical theories of Inspiration have not
          yet left us free to perceive those ordinary conditions of writing
          under which the New Testament writers wrote. The aftermath of
          Verbal Inspiration still blinds us to the commonplaces of
          composition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of all New
          Testament authors St. Luke is perhaps the last to have issued his
          works without modifications. The high art which is self-evident in
          a modern writer like Robert Louis Stevenson was not attained
          without corrections, substitutions, redrafting, and rewriting.
          Without drawing the parallel too closely, and without impugning his
          real inspiration, we may well credit some of these processes to St.
          Luke. This, however, is an argument we cannot press too far, for,
          as will be seen in the following section, there is good ground for
          the belief that St. Luke's revision of his work was never complete.
          It is sufficient for our hypothesis to find room for a measure of
          revision and for the presence of modifications required by new
          information.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The nature of
          St. Luke's task is an added reason for expecting these processes.
          In his Preface (i. 1-4) St. Luke shows a desire to produce a full
          and accurate record, and claims to have traced the course of all
          things from the first. Any new information bearing upon the Birth
          and the hidden years of the Infancy would be especially welcome to
          him. Any one, moreover, who has had anything to do with collecting
          memoirs knows that not infrequently new facts come to hand just
          when the task seems well-nigh completed, facts for which a place
          must be found, however great the difficulties may be.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are not
          indeed left entirely to conjecture. We can examine St. Luke's
          treatment of the Markan record. The modifications which he
          introduces are manifest, and they arise in different ways. Many of
          them are stylistic, others are intended to clear up difficulties,
          while it is in every way probable that others again are corrections
          introduced as the result of new information. If, from such causes,
          St. Luke does not hesitate to modify the statements of St. Mark's
          Gospel, it is inconceivable that he would have refrained from
          altering his own narrative if occasion should arise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have at least
          one definite example, within St. Luke's works, of a story which has
          been modified in the light of further <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> information. In Lk. xxiv there is good ground
          for thinking that the final parting of Jesus from His disciples is
          not described as an Ascension, and apparently it takes place at the
          close of Easter Day. In Acts i we have the story of a forty days'
          interval, during which the Risen Christ teaches His disciples the
          things concerning the Kingdom of God (i. 3). The Ascension is
          described as an act of visible levitation. Jesus is taken up into
          heaven and a cloud receives Him out of His disciples' sight (i. 9).
          As they stand gazing upwards two men appear by their side clothed
          in white garments, who declare that Jesus shall return in like
          manner as they beheld Him going into heaven (i. 10 f.). The
          disciples then return to Jerusalem. It can hardly be denied that
          this is a totally different story from that which is told in Lk.
          xxiv. Whatever its historical value may be the presumption is that
          it rests upon a tradition which had come to St. Luke's knowledge
          after he had completed his Gospel. Apparently he acquired his new
          information when it was too late to alter his earlier work.
          Otherwise we may believe that the story would have appeared in the
          Gospel and not in the Acts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may freely be
          granted that the foregoing considerations are of a purely general
          character. Admittedly they do not prove that Lk. i. 34 f. is a
          specific instance of modification. Our justification of this
          hypothesis is the results we have reached in Chapters II and III.
          What we have just urged, however, is sufficient to show that our
          theory is not by any means inherently impossible, but is consonant
          with St. Luke's procedure and methods as a writer.</p>

          Above Theory is Exposed</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now to
          consider what is perhaps the strongest objection to which our
          theory is exposed. It may be stated as follows:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the Virgin
          Birth is a later element in the Third Gospel introduced by St. Luke
          himself, the Evangelist's revision of cc. i, ii might reasonably
          have been expected to be much more thorough than it is. Why, for
          example, does he leave untouched the references to Joseph and Mary
          as <span class="tei tei-q">“the parents”</span> of Jesus? Why does
          he not qualify his ambiguous reference to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“their”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> purification? Why is he still untroubled by
          their astonishment, and by their failure to understand the words of
          Jesus at Jerusalem? Why does he not insert some clearer reference
          to the Davidic descent of Mary, or at least give us reason to
          believe that he looked upon Jesus as the adopted, and therefore
          legal, son of Joseph? Why does he leave the Sonship mentioned in
          the first part of the angel's speech (i. 31-3) apparently of a
          purely Messianic character? Why does he not provide occasion in the
          Annunciation for the terms of Mary's question in i. 34? In short,
          are we not back again face to face with the same difficulties with
          which our investigation opened? These are some of the difficulties
          which our theory raises.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In reply to this
          objection there are two preliminary considerations to be borne in
          mind. They are not arguments in the sense of things which can be
          proved; they are rather possibilities which ought seriously to be
          taken into account.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) In the first
          place it should be recognized that <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">we may not have all
          the details of St. Luke's actual reconstruction before
          us</span></span>. Something may have been altered or excised; we
          have the result; we may not have all the stages. Usener (EB., col.
          3350) has asserted that statements of fact have actually been
          omitted from the original narrative; he is even able to tell us
          what they are! He thinks that we can <span class="tei tei-q">“infer
          with certainty”</span> that in the original form of the narrative
          after i. 38 stood the further statement that Mary was then taken to
          wife by Joseph and that she conceived by him. Usener suggests that
          this statement was <span class="tei tei-q">“judged
          inadmissible”</span> by the redactor who interpolated i. 34 f., and
          that in consequence it was expunged. There can be little doubt that
          reasoning such as this requires omniscience as well as intuition!
          And the same criticism would be just in reply to any one who should
          elect to tell us exactly what St. Luke himself has altered or
          omitted. These are things which we do not know, and which we cannot
          know; we cannot even <span class="tei tei-q">“infer with
          certainty”</span> that St. Luke has omitted anything at all. But
          the broad possibility that he may have effected transformations and
          modifications in cc. i, ii, which we cannot now trace, is quite
          another matter, and, indeed, is by no means improbable. And if this
          is so, must it not affect the judgement we pass upon the skill or
          lack of skill which, on the theory proposed, St. Luke has shown? We
          may not know all. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg
          080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Obviously, we cannot prove this, but it is a consideration which we
          ought to have in mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) A second
          thing to be remembered is that, if our theory is true, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">we do not know
          anything of the actual circumstances under which the new tradition
          was introduced into the Gospel; it may have been in
          haste</span></span>. Did the story reach the Evangelist at the last
          moment? Or, if not, was there a process of sifting and testing of
          the new information, which left little time when at length the
          fateful decision was taken, and the Evangelist took up his pen?
          Again we cannot prove these things, but again we cannot deny them.
          And if we cannot deny them, we must not ignore them. Only if we do
          ignore these possibilities, are we at liberty to insist that the
          reconstruction should have been more drastic. If, as we ourselves
          think, the supposition is reasonable, that i. 34 f. was added when
          the Evangelist had only just heard of the Virgin Birth tradition,
          we have clearly a good answer to the objection we are
          considering.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
          arguments are speculative; there are, however, more positive
          considerations to urge. In addition to what has been said, we may
          point out (3) the fact that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">St. Luke's writings left his hand without a
          painstaking final revision</span></span>, and (4) <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the different effect
          upon the mind of a new piece of information as compared with a
          belief, which has been held for some time, and has already become
          an intellectual presupposition</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That St. Luke's
          writings left his hands without a final revision is strongly
          supported by the literary phenomena of the two works.</span></span>
          The clearest evidence is found in the Acts, in which we probably
          have a closer literary parallel to the Birth Stories of Lk. i, ii
          than in the rest of the Gospel itself. Writing on the Acts
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acts of
          the Apostles</span></span>, Eng. Tr., pp. 203 ff.) Harnack gives a
          list of more than two hundred <span class="tei tei-q">“instances of
          inaccuracy and discrepancy”</span>. Harnack does not accept them
          all, and shows that they are of different types, many of them being
          comparatively trifling and unimportant. Some are cases of
          anacoluthon and of transition from indirect to direct speech and
          vice versa. There are also <span class="tei tei-q">“cases where St.
          Luke introduces persons with a certain unconcern, or in other
          places seems to forget that he has already introduced them”</span>
          (p. 230). Harnack points out that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          details of a story are here and there inserted <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> later or again earlier than their
          proper place”</span> (p. 227), and he asserts that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“instances of redundancy, of awkward repetition, of
          silence upon important points, and of extraordinary brevity, can be
          adduced from different parts of the book”</span> (p. 230). He finds
          <span class="tei tei-q">“instances of discrepancy”</span> in the
          three accounts of the conversion of St. Paul, the letter of
          Claudius Lysias, the report of Festus, the last speech of St. Paul
          at Rome, and in other passages (p. 231).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Adequately to
          enter into this very interesting question would take us too far
          beyond the limits of our main subject. It is perhaps not unfair to
          suggest that Harnack's long list, as given in pp. 203-25, is
          capable of very considerable reduction. There is great force in
          Ramsay's remark: <span class="tei tei-q">“He who reads Luke without
          applying practical sense and mother-wit and experience will always
          misunderstand him”</span>, and in his caution: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“When you think you find an <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘inconsistency’</span> in Luke, you should look
          carefully whether you have been sufficiently applying these
          qualities, before you condemn the supposed fault”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Luke the
          Physician</span></span>, p. 55). Ramsay himself admits, however,
          that there are inconsistencies which cannot be denied, and holds
          that they show that <span class="tei tei-q">“the work never
          received the final form which Luke intended to give it, but was
          still incomplete when he died”</span> (ib., p. 24). In his earlier
          work, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">St.
          Paul the Traveller and the Roman Citizen</span></span>, Ramsay has
          made the same suggestion, illustrations of which he finds in Acts
          xvi. 19, 20 and xx. 4, 5.<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may describe
          the impression which St. Luke, as a writer, makes upon us by saying
          that, while his work is marked by great literary art, and while it
          is characterized by many striking instances of historical accuracy,
          yet, at the same time, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Evangelist shows a certain unconcern in
          matters of detail (Harnack would call it <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          certain literary carelessness”</span>), the results of which would
          probably have disappeared had he subjected his works to a close
          final revision. If this view is just there is little weight in the
          objection that, on the theory we have stated, St. Luke's
          reconstruction might have been expected to be more drastic than it
          is. The inconsistencies he has left are like those which we find
          elsewhere and are a feature of his works as they stand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) Our final
          argument is of a psychological kind. It rests, as we have said,
          upon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          difference between an intellectual prepossession and the first
          effect upon the mind of new information</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The previous
          argument might seem to point in another direction. Will not the
          character of St. Luke's writings sufficiently explain the literary
          phenomena of Lk. i, ii, on the view that he taught the Virgin Birth
          from the first? In the light of the discrepancies which occur in
          the Gospel and the Acts, can we not believe that after all the
          Virgin Birth is an original element in the Gospel? This contention
          would be an example of what Harnack has called attempting to gather
          apologetic figs from sceptical thistles.<a id="noteref_76" name=
          "noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> We do
          not think that in this case the harvest would realize
          expectations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must be
          remembered that the two cases are not parallel. In the one case we
          begin with a writer whose mind is filled with an intellectual
          presupposition, with a knowledge, that is to say, of the Virgin
          Birth presupposed. Under these circumstances the miracle must be
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a necessary stone in the
          structure”</span>, and its effect determinative. If the Virgin
          Birth had been known to St. Luke for some considerable time, we
          cannot think that Lk. i, ii would have possessed the features to
          which we have called attention in Chapter II. In the other
          case—that of our hypothesis—the Virgin Birth is a piece of new
          information, and, if this is so, we submit that inconsistencies
          left in the adapted narrative wear a different hue. It is one thing
          to introduce into a narrative what is inconsistent to one's
          presuppositions. It is quite another thing not to perceive
          inconsistencies at once, when our knowledge is enlarged by a
          totally new fact. A presupposition is much more despotic than a
          subsequent discovery.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg
          083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is common
          knowledge that the implications of a new point of view are not
          always immediately recognized. For a time old and new live
          together. It is not by any means an easy task to introduce into a
          narrative, constructed under the guidance of alien presuppositions,
          a fact of an entirely new order. That St. Luke should have
          performed his task so well argues no little skill in literary
          craftsmanship. That his work was not completely done is after all
          no more than we might expect. From the standpoint of literary
          exactitude, no doubt the better plan would have been to rewrite the
          narrative, or at least to subject it to a rigorous pruning. But we
          ought not to complain if these things have not been done. St. Luke
          was probably too much of an artist to feel the merciless logic of
          his new information; and the result is a compromise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In connexion
          with our theory we do not think that this is an unreasonable view
          to take. The difficulties are certainly much greater upon the
          theory that St. Luke knew of the Virgin Birth from the first.
          Granted certain presuppositions, and we can say with good reason
          what a writer like St. Luke would not be likely to do. Assume the
          entrance of a new fact, transforming by a whole world of difference
          the writer's point of view, and who can say just what he would do?
          We can say, of course, that he would introduce his new knowledge,
          if persuaded of its truth; but when we come to the details of
          reconstruction, we are face to face with the uncertainties of the
          personal equation. The logical procedure is drastic revision. If
          the writer stops short of this, as he may very well do, and
          attempts to fuse his material, seams must show and markings remain.
          This is precisely what we find in Lk. i, ii. In i. 34 f. and its
          context we can detect the seams; in c. ii we can see the
          markings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
          recognized that the situation is quite different on the view which
          credits i. 34 f. to a later Christian editor. Against this theory
          the objection we are considering has much greater force. For it is
          unlikely that the redactor would approach the Gospel with a
          knowledge of the Virgin Birth but lately gained. On the contrary,
          it would probably be a doctrine with which he had long been
          familiar. Accordingly, in addition to the other objections that we
          have raised against the theory of late interpolation, it would be
          legitimate to ask, Why has the redactor <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> not done his work better? Our own
          hypothesis—that St. Luke had only just entered into a knowledge of
          the new tradition—is, indeed, the one theory where we have the
          least need to ask this question.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the reasons
          given, we believe that the objection that St. Luke's revision
          should have been more drastic is not insuperable. That there is
          difficulty we allow. But there is probably no solution of the Lukan
          problem, not even the correct one, which will not leave
          difficulties of a kind. The problem is complex and the facts often
          elusive. It is on the ground that the theory we have sketched
          leaves least difficulties, and does justice to the facts as they
          appear, that we venture to find in it a reasonable solution of the
          problem of the Virgin Birth in relation to the Third Gospel and to
          St. Luke.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It remains for
          us to consider certain consequences which follow if our hypothesis
          is true.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) In the first
          place, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">we
          can claim St. Luke as a witness to the tradition of the Virgin
          Birth</span></span>. This is a result of first importance. For
          those who regard St. Luke as a very credulous person with a special
          <span class="tei tei-q">“fondness”</span> for <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“a good miracle”</span>, this conclusion will mean
          little. But for those who are impressed by his claim to be regarded
          as a good historical writer, it is not a view to be lightly
          esteemed. There are those who will consider that St. Luke's witness
          settles the historical question, and will be disposed on the ground
          of his authority to accept the tradition. But with greater reason
          there are others who will feel that, with all his excellences as an
          historian, St. Luke has the elementary human right to make a
          mistake, especially when he is dependent upon the evidence of
          others. The determining feature is clearly the character of his
          source or sources.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) A further
          fact to be noticed is that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">St. Luke's witness marks a very early stage in
          the spread of the Virgin Birth tradition</span></span>. In this
          respect there is a contrast between the Third and First Gospels. In
          the Third Gospel the tradition is stated, but its problems are
          scarcely felt. There is a foreshadowing of this in the words
          <span class="tei tei-q">“as was supposed”</span> in the Genealogy,
          but not more. St. Luke has not really felt the problem of the
          Davidic descent. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg
          085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          He has not envisaged that very striking treatment of the problem
          which we shall have occasion to point out in the Matthaean
          Genealogy (see pp. 89 ff.). St. Luke's narrative is neither
          didactic nor apologetic. It is almost, but not quite, a simple
          narrative of what is implicitly accepted as fact. In making this
          qualification we are thinking of the artistic form which the
          earlier narrative embodied in Lk. i, ii has imposed upon St. Luke's
          account of the Virgin Birth; but this is a matter which will come
          up again a little later. The fact that is of outstanding interest
          is that St. Luke could sit down to write a Gospel, with a desire to
          trace out all things accurately from the first, and yet know
          nothing of the Virgin Birth, until after the greater part, if not
          the whole, of his work was completed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It is the fact just
          noted which helps us to date the first appearance of the Virgin
          Birth tradition; its date is bound up with the question of the date
          of the Third Gospel.</span></span> This is a question which will
          receive further treatment in our final chapter (pp. 117 ff.).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Our hypothesis
          postulates an earlier narrative of the Birth of Jesus which knew
          nothing of the Virgin Birth. The relation of this narrative to the
          later tradition needs carefully to be considered.</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have already
          expressed the opinion that the earlier narrative was probably taken
          from a good historical source. Ramsay has noted signs of a womanly
          spirit in the whole narrative, and thinks that it may well go back
          either to Mary, or to some one who was very intimate with her (cf.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Was
          Christ Born at Bethlehem?</span></span>, pp. 74-88; <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Luke the
          Physician</span></span>, pp. 13, 50). Sanday is not able to speak
          quite so confidently as to the nearness of the source to Mary, but
          thinks that it could not be <span class="tei tei-q">“more than two
          or three degrees removed from her”</span>. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It must have been near enough”</span>, he says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to retain the fine touches which Professor
          Ramsay so well brings out”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Outlines</span></span>, p. 195 n.). These
          views have won considerable support in Great Britain. It will be
          remembered, of course, that they have regard to the whole of Lk. i,
          ii, to the narrative, that is to say, as an account of the Virgin
          Birth. The same arguments are valid, however, for ascribing a good
          historical foundation to the narrative, even if i. 34 f. is a later
          addition. The probability is that the source, whether documentary
          or oral, is of Palestinian origin, and that it <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> points back ultimately, if not
          immediately, to the Holy Family. On our theory, however, while
          silent as to the paternity of Joseph, the source had nothing to say
          of the Virgin Birth. It described the non-miraculous birth of the
          long-expected Messiah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first sight
          the high historical value of this earlier source would appear to be
          detrimental to the tradition of Lk. i. 34 f. But it is not certain
          that this is so. There is more force than has often been allowed in
          the suggestion that the facts of the Virgin Birth may have been
          purposely withheld from public knowledge for many years by those
          who knew them.<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href=
          "#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a>
          Assuming for the moment the truth of this view, we may ask,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Would
          nothing at all be told?</span></span> If we think it probable that
          part at least of the story would be related, it may be that the
          tradition upon which St. Luke first drew is a version of that part.
          We might even hazard the suggestion that it was the publication of
          this story by St. Luke which drew out the fuller narrative. In
          other words, the fact that the earlier tradition makes no reference
          to the Virgin Birth need not be fatal to the truth of the later
          story expanded in i. 34 f. This, of course, is speculation; but, at
          any rate, the possibilities are such as to forbid the specious
          argument—the Holy Family know nothing of the Virgin Birth! We tread
          upon firmer ground when we urge that the higher the historical
          value of the earlier story the less likely would St. Luke have been
          disposed to modify it in deference to further information, unless
          he had attached considerable value to the new tradition, and was
          persuaded of its truth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) As regards
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          origin of the Virgin Birth tradition implied in Lk. i. 34
          f.</span></span>, we have to confess that we are completely in the
          dark. We have stated our preference for the view that it came
          through a personal channel (p. 73). We are unable to think that in
          writing i. 34 f. St. Luke was himself merely translating theology
          into narrative. But who the intermediary was we cannot tell. On our
          theory, the tradition cannot have been <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> directly imparted to the Evangelist by Mary.
          Whether, in the end, the story can be traced back to her, is a
          question we cannot now discuss. At this stage it would be no more
          than a guess to connect it with the women mentioned in Lk. viii. 2,
          3; xxiv. 10, or with the daughters of Philip (Acts xxi. 8, 9). In
          an historical inquiry it is never safe to ascribe a tradition to an
          authority, unless we have solid grounds for so doing. Otherwise, we
          import a bias into the investigation, if indeed we do not beg the
          question. The mistake is one which has been made more than once in
          discussing the Virgin Birth. In the present case we have nothing
          whatever to guide us, and accordingly we have to acquiesce in the
          bare conclusion that St. Luke accepted the Virgin Birth tradition,
          but that we do not know anything about his authority, except that
          it satisfied his mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(6) The
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">form</span></span> in which the tradition
          reached St. Luke can hardly have been the brief statement of i. 34
          f. The literary form of that passage is determined by that of the
          earlier narrative. The latter, as we have said (p. 73), is
          something more than a bare transcript of events. It is a product of
          high art, and is shaped upon Old Testament models. Ramsay finds in
          it a Greek element. The story has been <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“re-thought out of the Hebraic into the Greek
          fashion”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Luke the Physician</span></span>, p. 13). The
          divine messenger becomes to St. Luke <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          winged personal being who, like Iris or Hermes, communicates the
          will and purpose of God”</span> (op. cit., p. 13). Having regard,
          however, to the Old Testament birth-stories of Isaac, Samson, and
          Samuel, it is doubtful if we really need this suggestion. In any
          case, we may say that it is the mould in which the earlier story
          has been cast, which accounts for the literary form of the Virgin
          Birth tradition in Lk. i. 34 f. The tradition which St. Luke
          received probably contained the substance of what is stated in
          verse 35, and asserted that Jesus was begotten of Mary by the Holy
          Spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(7) The
          historical value of the Virgin Birth tradition in the Third Gospel
          is a question which cannot be answered until the problem is treated
          as a whole. Our study of the Lukan problem adds to the material at
          our disposal. It confirms our conclusions in Chapter I as regards
          St. Paul and St. Mark. It also enables us to say that <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">St. Luke, in his
          later years, came to believe and teach the Virgin Birth, on grounds
          which are unknown to us, but which he himself deemed
          sufficient</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More than the
        other Synoptic Gospels, the First Gospel comes before us as an
        <span class="tei tei-q">“official”</span> document of the Christian
        Church. Our Third Gospel was somewhat of the nature of a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“private venture”</span>, and how inadequately the value
        of St. Mark's Gospel was recognized in the first half of the second
        century appears in the fact that its survival seems almost
        accidental, all existing copies being derived from a single mutilated
        MS.<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> Whether,
        then, we can claim the authority and sanction of the First Gospel for
        the Virgin Birth tradition, is clearly a question of first-rate
        importance. To some the question will appear determinative; but for
        those also, who feel that in any case the historical value of the
        witness would remain an open question, a conclusion as regards the
        problem is of very great significance, in view of its historical
        implications.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the present
        chapter our purpose is to inquire how far the First Gospel bears
        witness to the Virgin Birth, and what the character of its witness
        is. Was the narrative, as we have it to-day, present in the Gospel
        from the first? Is Mt. i, ii a later insertion, or is the passage i.
        18-25 an interpolation? Extremely interesting discussions have also
        arisen around the question of the Matthaean Genealogy and the true
        text of Mt. i. 16, and these call for notice. The question of the
        historical value of the tradition of Mt. i. 18-25 must in the main be
        postponed, but the possibilities, and such positive facts as emerge,
        can be noted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps the best
        method of approach is to consider first the character of the
        Genealogy, apart altogether from the question of its authorship. The
        details of the textual problem of Mt. i. 16 will be discussed in an
        Appendix to the chapter. The remaining points to be treated are the
        genuineness of cc. i, ii, the unity of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Genealogy</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          features which mark the Genealogy we may note the following:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Its
          purpose</span></span> is to show the Davidic descent of Jesus by
          tracing the royal line (cf. verse 6 <span class="tei tei-q">“David
          the king”</span>).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The structure is
          obviously artificial.</span></span><a id="noteref_79" name=
          "noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> The
          Genealogy is arranged in three groups of fourteen generations, an
          arrangement to which the writer himself calls attention (verse 17).
          In order to secure this structure, the names of Joash, Amaziah, and
          Azariah are omitted (cf. 1 Chron. iii) and the third group covers a
          space of about six hundred years. <span class="tei tei-q">“If any
          source of the schematism is wanted, the cabbalistic interpretation
          of דוד, whose three letters are equivalent by gematria to the
          number 14, is the most probable”</span> (Moffatt, INT., p. 250
          n.).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) The verb
          ἐγέννησεν is used throughout of legal, not physical, descent.<a id=
          "noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> This
          inference is drawn from the artificial character of the Genealogy.
          Its omissions are obvious, and must have been so both to the
          compiler and his readers. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          contemporaries of the Evangelist knew their Bible at least as well
          as we do. They knew that there were more than fourteen generations
          between David and the Captivity, that Joram did not beget Uzziah,
          and that Josiah did not beget Jeconiah”</span> (Burkitt,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evan.
          Da-Meph.</span></span>, ii, p. 260). If the passage Mt. i. 18-25,
          as well as the Genealogy, comes from the hand of the Evangelist,
          the verb ἐγέννησεν must clearly indicate legal parentage; but there
          is sufficient ground for this view within the Genealogy itself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) The
          references to women in the Genealogy are unique, and are best
          explained as due to an apologetic purpose. They cannot be so well
          explained as reflecting a universalistic interest (Heffern, quoted
          by Moffatt, INT., p. 251). In contrast to the Genealogy in the
          Third Gospel, that in Mt. traces the descent no farther
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name=
          "Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> back than to
          Abraham; it is fundamentally Jewish. There can be little doubt but
          that the writer's purpose is to rebut Jewish slanders already
          current regarding the birth of Jesus. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Throughout the whole Genealogy the Evangelist appears
          to be telling us in an audible aside that the heir had often been
          born out of the direct line or irregularly. Thamar the
          daughter-in-law of Judah, Rahab the harlot, Ruth the Moabitess, and
          the unnamed wife of Uriah, are forced upon our attention, as if to
          prepare us for still greater irregularity in the last stage”</span>
          (Burkitt).<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=
          "#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If these are the
          characteristic features of the Genealogy, it is clear that
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">from the
          first it was compiled with the Virgin Birth
          presupposed</span></span>. It is, in fact, an attempt to present
          that belief in connexion with the claim that Jesus was of Davidic
          descent, through the legal relationship in which He stood to
          Joseph.<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href=
          "#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> Thus,
          the Matthaean Genealogy is unique; it differs altogether from that
          in Lk. If to us its form seems forced and unreal, that is because
          we fail to come to it from the historical point of view. From this
          standpoint we may ask, with W. C. Allen (ICC., St. Mt., p. 6):
          <span class="tei tei-q">“If the editor simply tried to give
          expression to the two facts which had come down to him by
          tradition—the fact of Christ's supernatural birth and the fact that
          He was the Davidic Messiah, and did not attempt a logical synthesis
          of them, who shall blame him?”</span> We are not here concerned
          with the question of the truth of the Virgin Birth tradition, but
          simply with the view that the compiler of the Genealogy held that
          belief, and for this inference a high degree of probability can be
          claimed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this is the
          character of the Genealogy, it must follow that <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the textual problem
          of Mt. i. 16</span></span> differs considerably in importance from
          the thought of a quarter of a century ago. It is becoming
          increasingly recognized that, whatever the true text of Mt. i. 16
          may be, it can make little difference to the character of the
          Genealogy as outlined above. Its interest is textual and literary
          rather than historical. The most interesting statement of this
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name=
          "Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> point of view is
          that of F. C. Burkitt in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Evangelion Da-Mepharreshe</span></span> (1904,
          see vol. ii, pp. 258 ff.). On p. 258 Burkitt expresses a firm
          belief that no fresh light upon the historical events of the
          Nativity has been thrown either by the discovery of the Sinaitic
          Syriac MS. or by the publication of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialogue of Timothy
          and Aquila</span></span>. He says (p. 261) that even if the
          Genealogy had ended with the uncompromising statement <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and Joseph begat Jesus”</span>, it would not prove
          that its compiler believed that Joseph was the actual father of
          Jesus. In this connexion it is of great interest to note that
          Archdeacon Allen, who upholds the historical truth of the Virgin
          Birth, actually adopts in his commentary on Mt. (ICC., 1907) the
          reading implied by the Sin. Syr., as the true text of Mt. i.
          16—<span class="tei tei-q">“And Jacob begat Joseph. Joseph, to whom
          was espoused Mary a virgin, begat Jesus, who is called
          Christ”</span> (p. 5). Writing in 1916, Canon Box takes a different
          view of the textual problem, but is no less emphatic in his
          assertion that, <span class="tei tei-q">“even if the reading
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Joseph
          ... begat Jesus</span></span> be correct, it need not imply a
          belief in the natural generation of Jesus”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Virgin Birth of
          Jesus</span></span>, p. 15). Lastly, we may compare the judgement
          of Dr. James Moffatt (INT., 1918): <span class="tei tei-q">“Such
          modifications as may be due to doctrinal presuppositions are
          designed to re-set or to sharpen the reference of the original text
          to the virgin birth, not to insert the dogma in a passage which was
          originally free from it”</span> (p. 251). These are great and
          honoured names, but the opinion is not one which cries out for the
          cloak of authority; it springs directly out of the character of the
          Genealogy itself. If ἐγέννησεν is used throughout of legal
          parentage, it would clearly be so in the last step, if it should be
          proved that this also contained the word ἐγέννησεν. Indeed, we
          should naturally expect to find that word in verse 16.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same
          time, it would not be right to regard the textual problem as one of
          merely academic interest. It gives a valuable sidelight upon the
          history of the exegesis of Mt. i, ii in the early Christian
          centuries. It enables us to see how the Matthaean narrative was
          viewed, the difficulties it raised, and the way in which they were
          met. Thus it throws into strong relief the unique character of the
          Genealogy. It also sheds a welcome light upon the treatment which
          the text of the Gospels received at the hands of their earliest
          readers before these writings had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> acquired the status of sacred books. Even
          then if we have finally to acquiesce in Dr. Moffatt's statement:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The textual problem of i. 16 is not yet
          settled”</span>, the question is one of absorbing and of fruitful
          interest.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href=
          "#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> For
          our immediate purpose it is enough to say that the results, so far
          as they go, strengthen rather than weaken our belief that the
          compiler of the Genealogy worked under the presupposition of the
          Virgin Birth.</p>

          no longer be regarded as a burning question. Few scholars of the
          present day would contend that the First Gospel ever circulated
          without these chapters. In style, in vocabulary, and in mode of
          treatment, they are of a piece with the rest of the book.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">literary
          style</span></span> of the First Evangelist is not so marked as
          that of St. Luke, but it has nevertheless a distinct character of
          its own. As compared with that of St. Mark, it is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“more prosaic and colourless”</span>, but it is
          <span class="tei tei-q">“more calm and balanced”</span>

          Burkitt describes it as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“I wish I
          could think of some other word than <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘formality’</span> by which to name the chief
          characteristic of the First Evangelist's literary style. Formality
          suggests rigidity, generally with a certain measure of incapacity,
          and these are not among his defects. On the contrary, Matthew has
          great literary skill, as well as dignity. Everything that he says
          is put with admirable clearness and lucidity; what he writes down
          he has first understood himself. If there is an exception to be
          noted he notes it”</span> (GHT., p. 186). Now this same style is
          manifest everywhere throughout the Gospel, in cc. i, ii, as well as
          elsewhere.<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href=
          "#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          theory therefore that these chapters are a later insertion labours
          under an immense initial disadvantage. It requires to be explained
          how it is that this characteristic literary <span class=

          subject-matter of these chapters is peculiar and distinct.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The argument is
          not, of course, that no one but the First Evangelist could have
          used these words—that would be absurd; but that they are words
          which he uses frequently, and in nearly every case more frequently
          than any other New Testament writer.<a id="noteref_86" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An interesting
          fact is instanced by W. C. Allen (op. cit., p. lxxxvi). He notes as
          a characteristic of the Gospel <span class="tei tei-q">“a tendency
          to repeat a phrase or construction two or three times at short
          intervals”</span>. Fifteen examples of this are given, one of which
          occurs in Mt. ii. This last is an instance in which the genitive
          absolute is followed in three cases by ἰδού (ii. 1, 13, 19). We may
          add that the same construction appears in i. 20. Sir J. C. Hawkins
          shows (HS., 2nd Ed., pp. 5, 31) that there are seven instances of
          this construction in the rest of Mt., as compared with a single
          case in Lk. One other detail of construction may be noted. More
          than half the New Testament record of ἕως ἄν with the subjunctive
          (which occurs in ii. 13) belongs to the First Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          side, we have to set down the fact that in Mt. i, ii there are some
          twenty-eight words, exclusive of proper nouns, which do not occur
          in the rest of the Gospel.<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87"
          href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> But
          nearly half of these are accounted for by the subject-matter. The
          remaining instances are not more numerous than we might naturally
          expect. On the other hand, if cc. i, ii are a later insertion, we
          could reasonably look for more.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far, then, as
          the linguistic facts will take us, we may say that, considered as a
          whole, they support the view that Mt. i, ii are from the same hand
          as the rest of the Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) The
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mode of
          treatment</span></span> in these chapters is that of the First
          Evangelist. This writer is distinguished by the marked interest
          which he takes in describing the new faith as the true fulfilment
          of the old. This characteristic appears in the quotations which he
          makes from the Old Testament. Among these there are twelve which
          stand out distinct.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href=
          "#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> (i) In
          each case they are preceded by the words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in order that that which was spoken by the prophets
          might be fulfilled”</span>, or words to that effect. (ii) With one
          exception (iii. 3), they are quoted in this Gospel alone. (iii)
          What is more important, most of them are based upon the Hebrew,
          whereas the remaining quotations in the Gospel (except <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> xi. 10) are taken from the
          Septuagint.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href=
          "#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> For
          our present purpose the significant thing is that these
          characteristic quotations are distributed throughout the whole of
          the Gospel. No less than five of them occur in cc. i, ii, and it is
          not too much to say that their presence is a kind of water-mark
          authenticating the genuineness of these chapters.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Combining the
          foregoing arguments we may justly claim that the hypothesis of
          interpolation is violent in the extreme. Dr. Moffatt sums up a very
          widely accepted view when he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Neither
          the style nor contents of 1-2 afford valid evidence for suspecting
          that they are a later insertion in the gospel”</span> (INT., p.
          250).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The arguments
          used in the preceding section are sufficient to show that cc. i,
          ii, as a whole, come from the Evangelist's hand. But this
          conclusion does not exclude the possibility that certain parts may
          be of later date. In particular, it could be said, and has in fact
          been claimed that the Genealogy, the passage i. 18-25, or both, are
          interpolations; and that originally the First Gospel knew nothing
          of the Virgin Birth. These questions must now be treated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is not the
          same need for us to examine the section describing the visit of the
          Wise Men and its sequel (c. ii). This section is of great
          importance in a discussion of the Nativity narratives, but in
          relation to the Virgin Birth it is secondary as compared with the
          Genealogy and the passage i. 18-25. The section is treated by Canon
          Box in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <span style="font-size: 120%">1. The Genealogy</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are not
            concerned to ask at this point whether the Genealogy ever existed
            independently of the Gospel, and is thus a source which the
            Evangelist has worked up and incorporated in his own work. The
            question we have to consider is whether Mt. i. 1-17 is a genuine
            part of the Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The case in
            favour of this view is overwhelmingly strong. Its <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id=
            "Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> weight lies in the fact that
            the peculiar characteristics of the Genealogy (p. 89 f.) are the
            peculiar characteristics of the rest of the Gospel.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) This is
            manifest in the strong interest taken in the Davidic Sonship.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Gospel according to Matthew may be
            called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Book of Jesus Christ, the Son of
            David</span></span> ... The special aim of Matthew, in one word,
            is to represent our Lord as the legitimate Heir of the royal
            house of David”</span> (Burkitt, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evan.
            Da-Meph.</span></span>, ii, p. 259). We may partially illustrate
            this claim by the New Testament record of the term <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Son of David”</span>. There are 8 instances in Mt.
            other than i. 1, and 6 in the rest of the New Testament (3 in Mk.
            and 3 in Lk.). The regal aspect of Christ's Sonship is also
            illustrated in Mt. xix. 28, xxv. 34 (cf. Allen, op. cit., p.
            lxiv).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) As regards
            the artificial structure of the Genealogy, we may note that this
            too is characteristic of the First Evangelist's manner. He is
            fond of arranging his material in groups of threes. Allen
            enumerates twenty-three instances outside cc. i, ii (ib., p.
            lxv). Similarly the double seven reflects <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the author's penchant for that sacred number”</span>
            (Moffatt, INT., p. 250, who notes four other examples (p.
            257)).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) We are
            unable to illustrate from the rest of the Gospel the legal use of
            γεννάω, but where else save in the Genealogy could we expect to
            find it? It is the unique character of the Genealogy which
            requires that usage. On the other hand, the point of view which
            determines the usage is the point of view of cc. i, ii as a
            whole. As in i. 1-17, so in i. 18-ii. 23, the standpoint is that
            of a writer who desires to combine two diverse beliefs, the
            Virgin Birth and the Messiahship of Jesus.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) The
            apologetic motive manifest in the Genealogy is also
            characteristic of the First Gospel. Not only is the same motive
            present in every section of cc. i, ii, but in other connexions
            and in every part of the Gospel, the desire to defend and to
            interpret is evident; notably this is the case in the story of
            the Baptism, the account of the Guard at the Tomb and the
            Resurrection narratives.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90"

            18-25</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is this
            passage which leads us to the heart of the whole question, for
            here, in the angelic message to Joseph, the Virgin Birth is
            asserted unmistakably.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We should be
            justified in making use of the results we have already obtained.
            If the Genealogy comes from the hand of the Evangelist, and if it
            is of the character we have alleged, there can be no question but
            that Mt. i. 18-25 is also a genuine part of the Gospel. In view,
            however, of the importance of the section, it may be well not to
            avail ourselves of this argument.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Schmiedel's
            objections to the passage (EB., col. 2959 f.) may not unfairly be
            summarized as follows: (i) Mt. xiii. 55 (<span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Is not this the carpenter's son?”</span>)
            <span class="tei tei-q">“directly contradicts the theory of the
            Virgin Birth”</span>, (ii) Mt. ii can be understood without
            presupposing the story, (iii) Bethlehem is not mentioned until
            ii. 1, (iv) Mt. i. 18-25 is not from the same hand as the
            Genealogy, which <span class="tei tei-q">“could never have been
            drawn up after Joseph had ceased to be regarded as the real
            father of Jesus”</span>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of these
            arguments the last arises out of Schmiedel's view of the
            Genealogy, which is, that in its original form in the Gospel it
            asserted the physical paternity of Joseph (the Virgin Birth being
            a later insertion). Needless to say, on this view, Mt. i. 18-25
            must be rejected. We have already discussed the nature of the
            Genealogy, and have seen reason to take a totally different view
            of it. The Genealogy, as we understand it, furnishes no ground of
            objection to i. 18-25, but rather the contrary. Nor do
            Schmiedel's remaining objections carry the weight claimed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) As we have
            observed on p. 31, Mt. xiii. 55 simply reflects the opinions of
            our Lord's contemporaries. Unless we make the gratuitous
            assumption that the Evangelist would never have <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id=
            "Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reflected a view which he did
            not himself share, we are not justified in raising an objection
            to i. 18-25 from this particular passage.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) As regards
            c. ii, it is true that what is there related can, if necessary,
            be understood without presuming the story of i. 18-25.
            Nevertheless, the chapter is quite congruous with what is told in
            that passage, and, indeed, agrees better with the presupposition
            of the Virgin Birth. In a narrative written from the standpoint
            of Joseph, we may note that, while Mary is spoken of no less than
            five times as the mother of Jesus (ii. 11, 13, 14, 20, 21),
            wherever Joseph is mentioned, we have invariably the quite
            neutral expression <span class="tei tei-q">“the young
            child”</span> (ii. 13, 14, 20, 21). Also the quotation,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of Egypt did I call my son”</span>
            (ii. 15), by the very reason of its exegetical violence, is more
            intelligible if the Evangelist has already narrated the story of
            the supernatural birth. To have real weight, Schmiedel's
            objection should be able to point to more than the fact that c.
            ii can be read <span class="tei tei-q">“without the
            presupposition of the virgin birth”</span>. If i. 18-25 is an
            interpolation, we might reasonably expect statements in c. ii
            inconsistent with that passage. And, moreover, it would be
            gratuitous to say that they have been carefully suppressed, in
            view of those which survive in Lk. i, ii to which we have called
            attention in Chapter II.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) That
            Bethlehem is not mentioned until ii. 1 is true. But as an
            objection to i. 18-25 this fact would be of significance, if the
            latter were simply a narrative of the birth of Jesus. But to
            assert this is to mistake its character, which is didactic and
            apologetic. Joseph rather than Jesus is the central figure of the
            section; the birth is not announced until the closing words. The
            reference to Bethlehem in ii. 1 is certainly abrupt, but it would
            have been quite as abrupt in i. 25. Nothing in i. 18-25, if we
            have regard to its character, requires a reference to Bethlehem
            within the passage.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The onus of
            proof really rests upon those who deny the genuineness of i.
            18-25. It may not be without advantage, however, to set down
            reasons which lead us to believe that the passage comes from the
            Evangelist's hand.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(a) As in the
            case of Lk. i. 34 f. there is <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">no textual
            authority for the omission of these verses</span></span>. While
            we recognize the free <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg

            handling which the text of the Gospels may have received during
            the first half of the second century, it does not appear likely
            on general grounds that Mt. i. 18-25 is an interpolation. The
            addition to the text of a saying of Christ, or of a comment, or
            even of an incident drawn from floating Christian tradition, we
            can understand, as well as a certain amount of stylistic
            alteration. <span class="tei tei-q">“Doctrinal
            modifications”</span>, however, of such a wholesale character as
            the present instance would be, if the passage is a later
            insertion of unknown origin, are quite another matter. That Mt.
            i. 18-25 should have been inserted in a Gospel, which, on this
            theory, taught the physical paternity of Joseph, and should have
            been inserted without leaving traces in the literature of the
            early Christian centuries, is most improbable. The sole support
            from early Christian literature is the statement of Epiphanius
            that the text used by Cerinthus lacked the passage. Had we more
            information of this kind, there would be ground for the theory of
            interpolation; as it is, the basis is too slender and
            uncertain.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) In the
          earlier sections of this chapter an attempt has been made to prove
          that the Virgin Birth is an original element in the First Gospel.
          The suggestion that it is a later insertion from an unknown hand
          breaks down on examination, and our conclusion is that the doctrine
          was taught by the First Evangelist. There is no need to raise the
          question whether the doctrine was a later element introduced by the
          Evangelist himself into a work which originally knew nothing of it,
          for there is absolutely no evidence pointing in that direction. In
          this respect the passage Mt. i. 18-25 differs altogether from Lk.
          i. 34 f. Against the former passage no inconsistencies, either in
          the immediate context or in the Gospel as a whole, can be shown.
          From one end to the other the narrative is governed by the same
          presuppositions and reflects the same point of view.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether the
          Genealogy ever existed independently and in another form is a view
          for which little can be said. There are no grounds for this theory
          within the Genealogy as it stands, and the textual problem of Mt.
          i. 16 does not require the supposition (see pp. 105 ff.). The
          possibility cannot, of course, be excluded. If the Evangelist did
          make use of an existing Genealogy, it was probably one which
          implied the real paternity of Joseph. In that case he has
          completely transformed it, and must have done this either before,
          or at the time when he first wrote cc. i, ii. But the existence of
          such a source is pure speculation. It is more probable that the
          Genealogy is the Evangelist's own composition, constructed not for
          historical but for didactic purposes.<a id="noteref_94" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) The question
          of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          implications of Mt. i, ii</span></span> is one of great interest.
          The narrative is very far from being an attempt to relate the story
          of the Virgin Birth for the first time. On the contrary, it is
          probable that the doctrine was already known to the readers of the
          First Gospel, and that it had become a subject of controversy. It
          is from this point of view that the Evangelist writes; it is for
          this reason that he tells the story from the standpoint of Joseph.
          It is not difficult to imagine the circumstances under which the
          Matthaean narrative came to be written. Once the story of the
          Virgin Birth had begun to circulate, interest must soon have been
          aroused in the position and attitude of Joseph. How were his
          natural fears allayed? What action did he take? What became of the
          Davidic descent? Such questions would press for answer. Outside the
          Christian community these difficulties would inevitably become the
          occasion of scandal, as the case was in later times. The
          Evangelist's narrative is an attempt to meet these difficulties.
          His view, or the view he reflects, is that the fears of Joseph were
          allayed by a divine message. The subsequent action of Joseph, also
          under angelic direction, was to complete the legal act of wedlock
          before the child was born. The difficulty of the Davidic descent is
          the problem attacked in the Genealogy. According to several writers
          it is the same interest which governs the narratives of c. ii.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“... the Nativity Story shows us the alarm
          of the usurper Herod, when he learns that the legitimate ruler has
          been born within his dominions. As Saul tried to kill David, so
          Herod tries to kill Jesus; and Jesus finds a refuge in Egypt, as
          David found a refuge among the Philistines”</span> (Burkitt, op.
          cit., ii. 259; cf. Box, op. cit., p. 19).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) The question
          of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
          source or sources</span></span> from which the Evangelist obtained
          the narrative of Mt. i. 18-25 cannot be adequately discussed in
          itself and in relation to the First Gospel alone. Nevertheless it
          is worth while to ask how far we can go within those limits. From
          the evidence supplied by the Gospel itself, we cannot say that the
          narrative rests on the testimony of Joseph. If the Virgin Birth is
          historically true, this view has <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> much probability in its favour. But to urge
          such an origin for the Matthaean narrative, as part of the proof
          for the Virgin Birth, is not permissible, since obviously it begs
          the question. Many writers think that the narrative really does
          come from Joseph himself because it reflects his standpoint.
          Amongst others this is the opinion of Bishop Gore (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The New Theology and
          the Old Religion</span></span>, p. 126 f.), and of Dr. Orr
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
          Virgin Birth of Christ</span></span>, pp. 83 ff.).<a id=
          "noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> Such a
          conclusion travels beyond the facts of the case. That the narrative
          is written from Joseph's standpoint is, of course, beyond question.
          It may be, however, that this fact is sufficiently accounted for by
          the apologetic character of the narrative. We do not say here that
          this is the case, but we do say that to claim more is to put an
          outside interpretation upon the narrative. Eventually this is, of
          course, inevitable; our final conclusion reacts upon our view of
          the earlier problems; but in the constructive stage this is a peril
          sedulously to be avoided.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The possibility
          has to be allowed that the narrative of Mt. i. 18-25 may be the
          result of an inference which arose within the Christian community,
          and which has clothed itself in an imaginative and pictorial form.
          In answer to the question, How were the fears of Joseph allayed?,
          it would be natural to reply, By a divine message, and current
          beliefs would supply an explanation of the means and the method by
          which such a message would be conveyed. Angelic mediation would
          account for the one, just as revelation by a dream would explain
          the other.</p>

          Whether we ought to be so ready as we often are to suppose the
          existence of special information, documentary or oral, when the
          First Evangelist and St. Luke add details to the Markan narrative,
          or relate entirely new facts, is a pertinent question. In many
          cases there is much justice in the supposition. In other cases it
          may easily be that the new detail or narrative has been shaped by
          inferences playing upon difficulties or ambiguities left by earlier
          narratives and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg

          would be a perfectly natural circumstance, the existence of which
          would be more readily acknowledged if obsolete theories of
          Inspiration did not continue to exact unlawful tribute. In the case
          of the First Gospel this use of inference is sometimes manifest,
          especially in the accounts of the Burial and the Resurrection of
          Jesus.<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href=
          "#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Whatever judgement may be passed upon Prof. Kirsopp Lake's
          brilliant examination of the Resurrection narratives, there can be
          little doubt but that he has shown that inference, as well as
          information, shaped the formation of early Christian tradition.
          This conclusion, even if accepted, would not justify us in
          supposing that the narratives of Mt. i, ii are nothing more than
          the inferential resolution of difficulties left by the story of the
          Virgin Birth. But it would suffice to make it probable that, to an
          extent which we may leave undefined, inference did play its part,
          either in the mind of the Evangelist or in the thought of the
          Christian community.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is, indeed,
          quite possible to admit this view, and yet to hold that behind the
          narrative there is a nucleus of historic fact. Dr. Gore, who
          believes that the story goes back to Joseph, does not hesitate to
          say:</p>

          setting, specially calculated to appeal to Jews.... The task that

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From what has
          been said above it will be seen that, if we restrict ourselves to
          the First Gospel, there are three theories possible regarding the
          source or sources employed in i. 18-25. (i) The narrative, very
          much as it stands, may have come from Joseph himself. (ii)
          Inference and imagination may have played upon a nucleus of
          historic fact. (iii) The narrative may be a story without historic
          foundation, which has grown up, as the result of inference and
          imagination, in answer to difficulties arising out of a belief in
          the Virgin Birth antecedently held.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So long as we
          confine ourselves to the Gospel, it is not possible to choose
          between these views, unless we are prepared to assume that early
          Christian tradition cannot have been mistaken—an assumption which
          cuts the knot instead of untying it. As we are not ready to make
          that assumption, we have to be content to leave the possibilities
          open, and to regard the use of any one of them in the historical
          inquiry as illegitimate. In part this is a disappointing decision,
          but it is better to feel that we have solid ground beneath our
          feet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) The positive
          results to which we have been led are (i) that <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the First Evangelist
          knew of, and believed in, the story of the Virgin
          Birth</span></span>; and (ii) that <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the belief was shared
          by his readers, and had been held sufficiently long for some of its
          problems to be raised</span></span>. Unquestionably, this is an
          important result, and its place in the historical problem will fall
          to be considered later.</p>

            purposes of reference, the most important facts may be summarized
            as follows:</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(A) First, we
            have the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">text followed in the A V. and R
            V.</span></span>, which reads: Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰωσὴφ τὸν
            ἄνδρα Μαρίας, ἐξ ἧς ἐγεννήθη Ἰησοῦς ὁ λεγόμενος Χριστός. This is
            the text of all extant uncials, very many minuscules, and many
            versions (Sanday). <span class="tei tei-q">“It is definitely
            attested by Tertullian, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">De Carne Christi</span></span>, § 20”</span>
            (Burkitt).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(B) A
            different text is attested by the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">“</span><span style=

            "font-style: italic">”</span></span> <span style=
            "font-style: italic">Group</span></span>. It is implied by a
            number of important MSS. of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Latin
            Version</span></span>, by the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Armenian</span></span>, and by the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Curetonian Syriac</span></span>. This text
            is as follows: Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰωσὴφ ᾧ μνηστευθεῖσα
            παρθένος Μαριὰμ ἐγέννησεν Ἰησοῦν τὸν λεγόμενον Χριστόν.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(C) Thirdly,
            we have the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Sinaitic Syriac</span></span>. <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Sin.</span></span> reads: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Jacob begat Joseph; Joseph, to whom was betrothed
            Mary the Virgin, begat Jesus, who is called Christ,”</span> and
            implies Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἐγ. τὸν Ἰωσήφ· Ἰωσὴφ [δὲ] ᾧ μνηστευθεῖσα [ἦν] π.
            Μ. ἐγέννησεν Ἰ. τὸν λεγ. Χ. (Burkitt, p. 263). [The reading of
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Cur.</span></span> is: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Jacob begat Joseph, him to whom was betrothed Mary
            the Virgin, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">she</span></em> who bare Jesus the
            Messiah”</span>.] We may also mention here the passage from the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Dialogue of Timothy and Aquila</span></span>
            which Conybeare claims to be the true text of Mt. i. 16. The
            alleged quotation includes the text as given under (A) together
            with the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“And Joseph begat Jesus
            who is called Christ”</span>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1)
            Conybeare's claim, mentioned above, has failed to win general
            acceptance. It is rejected by Schmiedel,<a id="noteref_99" name=
            "noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> who
            justly asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“How can we suppose that an
            evangelist deliberately added the second half to the
            first?”</span> (col. 2961). Schmiedel's view is that in the
            passage cited from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Dialogue</span></span> <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“it is precisely the youngest text and the oldest
            which have found a place peaceably side by side in one and the
            same line”</span>. F. C. Burkitt's theory probably gives the best
            explanation. He does not think that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">And Joseph begat Jesus who is called
            Christ</span></span>”</span> is meant to be a part of the
            quotation of Mt. i. 16, but is simply the inference of the Jew.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Jew quotes the Genealogy and then draws
            his inference, which is of course repudiated by the Christian
            disputant</span></span>”</span> (p. 265). Accepting this view we
            may leave the supposed quotation outside our discussion. We may
            note, however, that, according to Burkitt, the second of two
            other quotations of Mt. i. 16 in the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Dialogue</span></span> is interesting
            <span class="tei tei-q">“as affording an actual proof that the
            phrase <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">husband of
            Mary</span></span>’</span> was liable to change”</span>. (p.
            265).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) G. H. Box
            regards the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Curetonian Syriac</span></span> as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“an interpretation rather than a
            translation of the Greek text given us by the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">‘Ferrar’</span> Group”</span> (p. 216). Burkitt
            thinks it is <span class="tei tei-q">“like an attempt to rewrite
            the text of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">S</span></span>”</span> (p. 263), but as he
            derives the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Sin.</span></span> from the same
            Group,<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href=
            "#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> his
            opinion leads to the same result. Directly or indirectly
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Cur.</span></span> is a witness for the
            text (B). As such its general character in Mt. i, ii needs to be
            taken into account. In i. 20 it has <span class="tei tei-q">“thy
            betrothed”</span> instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“thy
            wife”</span>. It omits <span class="tei tei-q">“her
            husband”</span> in i. 19. In i. 24 it substitutes <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Mary”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“thy
            wife”</span>. In i. 25 it shares with the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Diatessaron</span></span> the reading
            <span class="tei tei-q">“purely dwelling with her”</span>, and it
            renders ἐκάλεσεν by <span class="tei tei-q">“she called”</span>.
            It is clear that its text is <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dominated by a
            desire to assert unmistakably the historic fact of the Virgin
            Birth</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) W. C.
            Allen takes the Greek text implied in the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Sin.</span></span> to be the true text
            of Mt. i. 16. Burkitt, as we have seen, derives it from (B). For
            the present it is important to consider <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span>
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name=
            "Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style=
            "font-style: italic">character of the Syr.-Sin. in relation to
            the Virgin Birth</span></span>. In i. 21, with the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Curetonian</span></span>, it adds the words,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“to thee”</span>. In i. 25 it omits
            <span class="tei tei-q">“knew her not until”</span>, and, as in
            the English versions, it renders ἐκάλεσεν by the masculine; in
            the same verse it also has the reading, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“she bore him a son”</span>. At first sight it would
            appear as if the tendency of the MS. is in direct opposition to
            the doctrine of the Virgin Birth; it is, however, very
            questionable if this is the case. It is not improbable that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“he knew her not until”</span> (omitted
            also by the Old Lat. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">k</span></span>) is an interpolation in the
            First Gospel. Burkitt thinks that <span class="tei tei-q">“to
            thee”</span> in i. 21 appeared in the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangelion
            Da-Mepharreshe</span></span>, and that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“him”</span> is a <span class="tei tei-q">“mere
            stylistic addition”</span> in the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Sin.</span></span> When we add that
            this MS. includes Mt. i. 18-25, and the parenthesis, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“to whom was betrothed Mary the Virgin”</span>, in
            Mt. i. 16, it becomes impossible to suppose that its text is of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ebionite origin”</span>. Nor is it any
            more likely that it represents <span class="tei tei-q">“the slip
            of a scribe”</span>. It is too much of a piece with the entire
            representation of the MS., of which the most we can say is that
            it hardens the unique point of view which is characteristic of
            the Evangelist himself. Whether it represents the original ending
            of the Genealogy, in a form independent of, and earlier than, the
            First Gospel, is a point which may be left open, though the view
            is not one which otherwise finds support from the Genealogy, as
            it now appears in the Gospel.<a id="noteref_101" name=

            any case, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">we ought very probably to reject the view
            that the Syr.-Sin. in Mt. i. 16 asserts, or implies, the physical
            paternity of Joseph</span></span>. It clearly takes ᾧ to
            <span class="tei tei-q">“refer to ἐγέννησεν as well as
            μνηστευθεῖσα”</span> (Burkitt, p. 263), but, having regard to its
            character as a whole, the strong probability is that it
            interprets ἐγέννησεν in the same sense which it bears throughout
            the earlier links of the Genealogy, viz. of legal parentage
            (Allen, p. 8). <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">In this case the scribe who produced the

            open to question.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) As regards

            before us.</p>

            then, explain the textual facts already noticed, if we presume
            the originality of</span></span> (A)?</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
            certainly remarkable that, after using ἐγέννησεν in a legal sense
            throughout the earlier links of the Genealogy (Moffatt, Burkitt,
            Westcott, Box, Allen, Barnard, A. J. Maclean), the compiler
            should desert this practice, and use the verb of physical
            parentage (ἐγεννήθη) in the last link of the chain. The compiler,
            if we may say so, does not strike us as the kind of man who would
            have felt the need of this. It seems much more likely that,
            together with some qualifying clause in reference to Mary, he
            would have continued to employ ἐγέννησεν in the same sense to the
            end. This is conjecture; but (on the present theory) it is a
            conjecture supported by the procedure of the scribes who have
            produced (B). Their object (on the present supposition) will have
            been to remove the ambiguities of (A) in Mt. i. 16, so as to
            state the doctrine more clearly. We could understand, then, their
            objection to τὸν ἄνδρα Μαρίας, and the change to ᾧ μνηστευθεῖσα
            π. Μ. What is less easy to understand is the change from ἐγεννήθη
            to ἐγέννησεν. It is true that ἐξ ἧς ἐγεννήθη is not without
            ambiguity, as the comment of the Jew in the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialogue of Timothy
            and Aquila</span></span> shows.<a id="noteref_102" name=
            "noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a>
            But, if this was a ground of objection, why should the ambiguity
            be replaced by one that is much greater? As we have seen, the
            construction of (B) is singularly loose. It is this fact which
            has clearly invited the modifications represented in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Cur.</span></span> and the Old Lat.
            MSS., and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg
            109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            perhaps the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Sin.</span></span> itself. The reading
            (B) certainly does not commend itself as a doctrinal modification
            of (A). Further, the priority of (A) does not help us to account
            for (C). If, as we believe, (C) is derived from (B), it is
            needless to discuss the point. But apart from that theory of the
            origin of (C), our conclusion remains the same. We have seen how
            near in spirit the scribe of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Sin.</span></span> was to the First
            Evangelist. Can we suppose, then, that he would have demurred to
            the words, τὸν ἄνδρα Μαρίας? It is very difficult to think so.
            For these reasons, in spite of its strong attestation, we find it
            impossible to presume the originality of (A).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2)
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We
            reach a similar conclusion, if we assume</span></span> (B)
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to be
            the true text of Mt. i. 16.</span></span> Its singular
            construction does not readily suggest the craftsmanship of the
            compiler of the Genealogy. It is true that we can give a very
            good account of (C) on the present assumption. We can adopt
            Burkitt's suggestion, and regard it as a paraphrase of (B). But
            can we derive (A) from (B)? It would be reasonable to explain ἐξ
            ἧς ἐγεννήθη as a correction of ἐγέννησεν by a believer who failed
            to understand the Evangelist's point of view, and who desired a
            clearer reference to the Virgin Birth. But can we imagine a
            scribe, or an editor, motived in this way, replacing <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“to whom was betrothed the Virgin Mary”</span> by the
            words <span class="tei tei-q">“the husband of Mary”</span>? The
            question answers itself, and forbids the assumption of the
            priority of (B).</p>

            is quite possible, on this theory, to give a reasonable
            explanation of (B), but, as in the last case, the difficulty is
            to account for (A). We can follow the change from ἐγέννησεν to ἐξ
            ἧς ἐγεννήθη, but the substitution of τὸν ἄνδρα Μαρίας for the
            parenthesis found in (C) remains as before an insuperable
            objection. At the same time Archdeacon Allen has laid down a true
            and a valuable principle when he writes: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The earliest Greek form was gradually altered from a
            desire to avoid words which, though in the intention of the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name=
            "Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> writer they
            expressed legal parentage, not paternity, in fact, might be
            misunderstood by thoughtless readers”</span> (p. 8).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our results
            thus far are negative, but they are not barren. We have frankly
            to admit that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">no extant reading, as a whole, commends
            itself as the original text of Mt. i. 16</span></span>. On the
            other hand, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">we can form a reasonably good idea of what
            that text was like</span></span>. If we are to make any further
            advance, we must have recourse to <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">conjecture</span></em>. It is not at all
            impossible that future discoveries may enable us to travel upon
            firmer ground. Such a discovery as that of the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Sin.</span></span> MS. by Mrs. Lewis
            and Mrs. Gibson in 1902 shows that this hope is not unreasonable.
            But meantime, unless we are content to acquiesce in a negative
            conclusion, we have no choice but to resort to conjecture. This
            does not mean a leap in the dark. It is in every way likely that
            parts of the true text are embedded in the extant readings, and
            it is by no means impossible that, taken together, these readings
            may contain the whole. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">It may be, that is to say, that the true
            text of Mt. i. 16 has found its grave in the readings we
            possess.</span></span> Whether its resurrection can be
            accomplished is another question. But, in view of the general
            character of the true text, as indicated above, the attempt need
            not be foreclosed. Obviously, our results will be tentative, but
            they should be something more than dubious and uncertain in the
            extreme.</p>

            compiler's method. <span class="tei tei-q">“The practice of the
            writer is to interpose no words between the name and the verb
            ἐγέννησεν”</span> (Burkitt, p. 263). (ii) This order enables us
            to give an explanation of the fact that both (A) and (B) omit the
            second Ἰωσήφ (see below).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gathering
            together these several results, we obtain the following as the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to
            the reasons already given, we may also urge the fact that, with
            this text posited, we can give the simplest and least involved
            account of the origin of (A), (B), (C).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The
            scribes who have produced (A) substituted the passive (ἐγεννήθη)
            for the active (ἐγέννησεν). This caused the second Ἰωσήφ to drop
            out, its place being taken by ἐξ ἧς <span class="tei tei-q">“from
            whom”</span> (fem.). Ἰησοῦς ὁ λεγ. Χρ. followed as a grammatical
            change.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) All that
            the originators of (B) had to do was to substitute ᾧ μνηστ. π. Μ.
            for τὸν ἄνδρα Μ., and then, by omitting Ἰωσὴφ δέ, to leave Μ. as
            the subject of ἐγέννησεν.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) We may
            explain (C), with Burkitt, as derived from (B). The Syriac
            translator was not satisfied with the loose construction of (B).
            Taking ᾧ to refer to ἐγέννησεν as well as to μνηστευθεῖσα, he
            made the connexion clearer by inserting a second Ἰωσήφ as the
            subject of the verb. In taking this last step, he either returned
            unconsciously to part at least of the true reading, or had access
            to good Greek MSS. which we no longer possess.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is of
            interest to compare the reading we have suggested as the original
            text of Mt. i. 16 with others which have been put forward. In
            discussing one of these possibilities, Sanday writes
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Outlines</span></span>, p. 200):
            <span class="tei tei-q">“If we may suppose that the original text
            ran Ἰωσὴφ τὸν ἄνδρα Μαρίας ἣ ἐγέννησεν Ἰησοῦν τὸν λεγόμενον
            Χριστόν, that would perhaps account for the two divergent lines
            of variants better than any other”</span>. In spite of its
            advantages, this text suffers under two disadvantages from which
            the one we have preferred is free. (i) Not only is γεννάω used in
            a different sense from that which it has in the rest of the
            Genealogy, but it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">the very same form of the verb</span></em>
            which is employed differently. (ii) The reading is too smooth and
            clear. Apart from the phrase τὸν ἄνδρα Μ. no loophole is left for
            misunderstanding, and so no sufficient starting-point is provided
            for the subsequent textual variants.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Burkitt has
            instanced the reading we have preferred. In rejecting the view
            that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Sin.</span></span> represents the true
            text, he writes (p. 264): <span class="tei tei-q">“Had we such a
            text as Ἰακ. δὲ ἐγένν. τὸν Ἰωσὴφ τὸν ἄνδρα Μαρίας· Ἰωσὴφ δὲ
            ἐγέννησεν κτλ. the case would have <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> been different”</span>. In reference to
            this suggestion, however, Burkitt says, (i) the evidence does not
            point that way, (ii) in that case the <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Sin.</span></span> would be further
            from the original than that of א B and Tertullian, (iii)
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Syr.-Sin.</span></span> and <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span>
            would <span class="tei tei-q">“agree in a common
            corruption”</span>, and we should have to speak of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Western”</span> text in the singular
            number.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last point
            raises a large question which it is impossible to consider here.
            As regards the second objection, while in some respects (C) would
            be further from the original than (A), in other and more
            important respects it would be appreciably nearer. In its use of
            ἐγέννησεν it would be nearer to the original than any reading we
            possess. As regards the first objection, we have frankly to agree
            that the textual evidence does not point that way. We cannot
            point to a shred of MS. evidence to support the conjectured
            reading. A generation ago this would have been considered a fatal
            objection. But, in view of the freedom with which the text of the
            Gospels was handled during the first half of the second century,
            and which the textual variants illustrate, this objection can no
            longer be regarded as insuperable. So long as we restrict
            ourselves to the attested readings, the problem remains
            insoluble. If, then, we can reach a reasonable conclusion on
            other lines, we are free to do so. Doubtless, in default of
            attestation, we can describe our results as no more than
            tentative. But we have no desire to claim more. As the problem
            stands at present, the test to be applied is, What reading,
            conjectured or attested, furnishes the best explanation of the
            facts at our disposal?, it being remembered that these facts
            include, not only the textual variants, but also the unique
            character of the Genealogy itself. It may be, as we have
            suggested, that new discoveries await us. But, unless we have
            entirely misread the evidence we already possess, no discovery is
            to be expected which will completely transform the textual
            problem.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In conclusion,
            we may state certain propositions (apart from the question of the
            exact wording of the true text of Mt. i. 16) which have in their
            favour a high degree of probability.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The
            readings which we have called (A) and (B) are independent
            attempts to alter the original text in the interests of the
            Virgin Birth; that is, they are <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“doctrinal modifications”</span>.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) The
            reading of the Sinaitic Syriac is not unfavourable to the

            "Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> doctrine. It
            should no longer be spoken of as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            eccentric reading”</span>, nor should we describe the translator
            as influenced by <span class="tei tei-q">“heretical

        Its Limits And Bearings</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our purpose in the
        final chapter is to co-ordinate the results we have reached, and to
        discuss their bearing upon the historical question of the Virgin
        Birth. We have also to determine how far strictly historical
        considerations can take us; to ask, that is to say, within what
        limits the problem is historical at all. It will be well first to
        summarize the conclusions to which we have already come.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The Virgin
        Birth was not the subject of Apostolic preaching, and apparently was
        unknown to St. Paul and St. Mark.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) St. Luke
        became acquainted with the tradition for the first time, either when
        he was in process of writing his Gospel, or immediately
        afterwards.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) The First
        Gospel presupposes the Virgin Birth tradition, which had probably
        been known to its readers for some time, sufficiently long for
        problems to be started and for difficulties to be raised.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) No
        satisfactory proof is forthcoming to show that the Fourth Evangelist
        definitely rejected the tradition. The most we can say is that his
        doctrinal sympathies lay in another direction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the positive
        side our most important result is that we can prove from the New
        Testament itself that belief in the Virgin Birth existed in
        influential Christian communities at the time when the First and
        Third Gospels were written. We have no further need, therefore, to
        consider theories which assign the belief to a later age, and which,
        by various interpolation-hypotheses, deprive the doctrine of New
        Testament support. Those who have stated such theories have rendered
        service in that they have explored an alternative path. On the view
        we have preferred this path proves to be a cul-de-sac. We have
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116"
        id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> therefore, to recognize that,
        whether we accept or reject the Virgin Birth, we must do this in full
        acknowledgement of the fact that among early witnesses to the belief
        are two outstanding New Testament Writings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Can we go further
        than this? To do so we must consider the First and Third Gospels, in
        respect of their mutual relations and of what they conjointly
        imply.</p>

          Third Gospels</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In considering
          the relation in which the First and Third Gospels stand to each
          other and to the Virgin Birth three questions are of the greatest
          interest and importance. (1) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">To what extent do the two Gospels imply a
          common tradition and belief?</span></span> (2) <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">How far back can we
          trace this tradition?</span></span> (3) <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In what relation does
          the public tradition stand to the theory of an earlier tradition of
          a private and restricted character?</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) In answer to
          the first question, our view is that <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">each Gospel, in a
          different way, is a witness to the same tradition</span></span>.
          Too much has frequently been made of the theory that in Mt. and Lk.
          we have two independent accounts of the Virgin Birth tradition. It
          may seriously be questioned if this theory is true. Mt. i. 18-25 is
          misunderstood if it is explained as a Virgin Birth tradition. Like
          the rest of cc. i, ii, its character is Midrashic, and it is
          written from an apologetic standpoint. It would therefore be much
          truer to say that it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">implies</span></em> the existence of a Virgin
          Birth tradition as known to the readers of the Gospel. What form
          that tradition took we are of course unable to say. It is possible
          that it was similar to the tradition as it appears in Lk. On the
          other hand, it may be that even in Lk. the form in which the
          tradition is presented owes something to the Evangelist's
          craftsmanship. If this is so, it would seem that the narratives of
          both writers point back to a simpler tradition or belief, from
          which, in different ways, they came to assume their present form.
          What is of chief importance is the view that in both Gospels we
          have, not so much two independent narratives of the Virgin Birth,
          as rather two independent witnesses to what originally was one and
          the same tradition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It cannot escape
          our notice that, in spite of their obvious differences, Lk. i. 34
          f. and Mt. i. 18-25 contain what is substantially <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the same statement, a statement which
          in each passage is central. In Mt. i. 20 we read: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">That which is conceived</span></span> (τὸ ...
          γεννηθέν) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">in her is of the Holy
          Spirit</span></span>”</span>; and in Lk. i. 35, after the reference
          to the Holy Spirit, we read: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That which is to be
          born</span></span> (τὸ γεννώμενον) <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">shall be called holy,
          the Son of God</span></span>”</span>. There is much to be said for
          the view that both expressions point back to a common original, to
          a primitive belief that Jesus was <span class="tei tei-q">“born of
          the Holy Spirit”</span> (cf. Harnack, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Date of
          Acts</span></span>, &amp;c., pp. 142 ff.).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If then we are
          unable to accept the view that in Mt. and Lk. we have two
          independent accounts of the Virgin Birth, we may well ask if the
          loss is a real one. It is probably nothing of the kind. There was
          indeed a certain advantage in feeling able to point to two diverse
          traditions which converged upon one fact. Nevertheless, the
          argument always had a certain weakness. We had to account for the
          two different traditions, and the explanation was a theory we could
          never prove. It may be that St. Luke's story goes back for its
          authority to Mary; it is very doubtful if St. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Matthew's”</span> has any historical connexion with
          Joseph; but in either case neither assumption is justifiable in an
          historical inquiry. It must be allowed, we think, that our view has
          sounder advantages. Instead of claiming validity for two diverse
          traditions, we can point to two very different narratives, which
          arise out of the same belief and are independent witnesses to its
          existence in the primitive Christian community.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">To what point, then,
          can we trace this tradition?</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have argued
          that the Virgin Birth tradition first began to gain currency in the
          circles in which St. Luke moved at the time when the Third Gospel
          was being written. We have also seen that the tradition was already
          known to the readers of the First Gospel. If these conclusions are
          valid, it is evident that the relative order in which the two
          Gospels were written will determine the farthest point to which we
          can trace the Virgin Birth tradition as publicly known. What, then,
          is the order of composition in the case of Mt. and Lk.?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may frankly
          admit that if priority must be assigned to Mt., it becomes
          difficult to understand how St. Luke could have no knowledge of the
          Virgin Birth at the time when he first took up his pen. For, on
          this view, we ask, Must not the tradition have already reached the
          circles in which he was moving at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> time? It would certainly be more favourable
          to our theory if we could assign priority to the Third Gospel. In
          this case we should have a very simple account to give of the
          history of the tradition. We should discover it emerging for the
          first time in St. Luke's Gospel, and we should have a ready
          explanation (in the fact of the interval between the two works) for
          the apologetic note in the later Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the priority
          of the two Gospels is not a question to be decided simply by the
          attitude which the Evangelists display towards the Virgin Birth.
          Mt. and Lk. must be compared throughout. When this is done there do
          not appear to be sufficient grounds for giving a vote in either
          direction (cf. Stanton, GHD., ii, p. 368). All that we can say is
          that the two Gospels are independent works, and must have been
          written about the same time. If there was an interval, it cannot
          have been great, for there are no sufficient signs that either
          writer was acquainted with the work of the other. It is especially
          difficult to think that St. Luke would have neglected the First
          Gospel, if it had been accessible to him (cf. Lk. i. 1-4).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, however, we
          accept, as a working hypothesis, the view that the two Gospels were
          written independently of each other, and more or less
          simultaneously,<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href=
          "#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a> it
          will still follow that the Virgin Birth tradition was already known
          in at least one influential primitive Christian community (that to
          which the First Gospel was addressed) while it was unknown to St.
          Luke.<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href=
          "#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> Is
          this a fatal objection, or does such a position represent what may
          well have been the actual situation? We do not think that the
          difficulty is too great.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tides by
          which traditions flow in different places are not simultaneous;
          they differ in time, in height, and in volume. No practice could be
          more mischievous than the habit of dating the relative spread of
          early beliefs simply by the dates of contemporary documents. Regard
          must be paid to local conditions.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In life as in
          nature there are variations of current and of coast formation.
          There are limits, of course, within which this caveat holds good;
          but, provided the interval of time is not too great, the view that
          St. Luke could begin to write in ignorance of a tradition already
          known elsewhere is not self-condemned. After all, St. Luke himself
          had access to much tradition which presumably was unknown to the
          First Evangelist (witness St. Luke's special matter).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Concerning the
          length of time we can allow the Virgin Birth tradition to have been
          already known elsewhere, when St. Luke began to write, there is
          room for difference of opinion. If, as we have contended, he became
          acquainted with it in the process of writing or immediately
          afterwards, the period can scarcely have been considerable. Perhaps
          it ought to be estimated in months rather than in years, but to say
          more would be idle speculation.</p>

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The farthest point
          therefore to which we can trace the existence of the Virgin Birth

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) It is a
          perfectly fair assumption to make that the public tradition must
          have had a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">private</span></em> vogue before, and perhaps
          for some time before, it became public property. This view becomes
          especially probable in the light of what we have just seen, viz.
          that the spread of the public tradition among the primitive
          Christian communities covered an appreciable period of time. The
          question of the historical truth of the Virgin Birth is precisely
          the question of how far back the private tradition can be traced;
          whether it can go back to Mary the mother of Jesus, and whether
          satisfactory reasons can be given for a silence which extends
          beyond the period covered by the Pauline Epistles and the Second
          Gospel, and is broken only at last in the interval which shortly
          preceded the composition of the Gospels of Mt. and Lk. In this lies
          the real historical problem. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Relation to the Virgin Birth Tradition</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The relation in
          which the question of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the Date of the Gospels</span></span> stands
          to the results reached is sufficiently clear. If we could fix the
          time when Mt. and Lk. were written, we could determine within
          comparatively narrow limits when the Virgin Birth tradition first
          gained currency. A conclusion upon this point would materially
          affect our estimate of the historical value of the tradition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Until this stage
          we have deliberately refrained from assigning dates to the Gospels.
          The only things we have assumed are the priority of Mk. and the
          practically contemporaneous origin of Mt. and Lk. Our justification
          for this course lies in the great variety of opinion which exists
          on the question of date, and hence the desirability of keeping
          clear, as long as we can, from considerations which must vitally
          affect the results secured.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately,
          as we have said, no sort of unanimity exists upon the question of
          the date of the Gospels. A glance at the extremely useful table
          which Dr. Moffatt prints on page 213 of his Introduction makes this
          clear. At first sight the position would appear chaotic, and we
          might well shrink from attempting to connect our results with
          specific dates. It is impossible, moreover, in a work like the
          present, to discuss the question in detail. Such a problem ought to
          be considered independently, and with regard to all the facts of
          the case. It would seem best therefore to ask what the consequences
          are, if we incline to any one of certain representative dates. We
          are at liberty, of course, to indicate our personal preferences,
          but, for the reasons stated, we shall have to agree to a measure of
          uncertainty. This is disappointing, but the responsibility must lie
          at the right door, and that door is the present failure of Biblical
          Scholarship to arrive at a consensus of opinion on the question of
          the date of the Gospels. Perfect agreement there will never be, but
          until there is substantial agreement every historical investigation
          into questions of New Testament origins must prove incomplete.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The problem of
          the date of the Gospels is not, however, so chaotic as might at
          first sight appear. There is a strongly marked disposition to
          recede from the extremes on both sides, and there is a very
          considerable agreement that the period from 60 to <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> 100 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> covers the time
          during which the Synoptic Gospels were written. There is also a
          consensus of opinion that the Second Gospel cannot have been
          written later than about 70 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> Every decade, and
          almost every year, however, between 60 and 100 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> finds advocates for
          the composition of Mt. and Lk. There are, nevertheless, three
          periods which find special favour. These may be briefly
          mentioned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The first
          period we may note is the closing years of the first century. For
          this view the main arguments are (i) the supposed dependence of St.
          Luke upon Josephus, and (ii) the ecclesiastical tone of certain
          passages in the First Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) A second
          view brings both Mk. and Lk. within St. Paul's lifetime, and dates
          Mt. shortly after the fall of Jerusalem. This is the opinion of
          Harnack (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Date of Acts and of the Synoptic
          Gospels</span></span>). It has not won a large following, either in
          Germany or in this country, but it is probably nearer the truth
          than the previous view.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) A third
          period is the time about 80 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> One advantage of this
          view, as Dr. Plummer candidly admits (ICC., St. Lk., p. xxxi), is
          the fact that it avoids the difficulties which beset the other two.
          The main argument which commends it to Dr. Plummer is that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“such a date allows sufficient time for the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘many’</span> to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘draw up narratives’</span> respecting the acts and
          sayings of Christ”</span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It remains for
          us to indicate what bearing these representative dates have upon
          the Virgin Birth tradition in the light of our results.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is clear that
          if we must date Mt. and Lk. in the closing years of the first
          century, the historical value of the tradition is reduced to a
          minimum. For, if that tradition is historical, we are compelled to
          assume that for a period of about ninety years the story was
          jealously guarded, first by Mary herself and then by a chosen few
          to whom it was revealed. But who will believe this? If we accept
          Harnack's dates, then the period about 60 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> will be the time when
          belief in the Virgin Birth first began to spread. While, if we
          prefer the third alternative, we must fix upon a time some fifteen
          to twenty years later, i.e. the period from 75 to 80 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is evident
          that the case for the historical truth of the tradition
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name=
          "Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is at its strongest
          if Harnack's dates can be accepted. Looking at the question from
          the sole standpoint of the time-interval, we do not believe that
          the third period is impossibly late. However we look at the
          question, we are unable to bring the public tradition within the
          lifetime of Mary. But, provided we are not compelled to date the
          Gospels at the close of the century, there do not seem to be
          insuperable difficulties—so far as the time-element is
          concerned—against connecting that public tradition with those who
          were near her person.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen
          that the question of the date of the Gospels is an important one.
          The utmost, however, we are able to glean in this field is a
          somewhat negative advantage. Our conclusion is that no insuperable
          difficulty stands in the way. Obviously, the onus of proof yet
          remains. The long period of silence must be explained, and the
          truth of the tradition vindicated.</p>

          the Historical Value of the Gospels to the Problem</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must next
          briefly consider the question of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the historical value
          of the Synoptic Gospels</span></span>, so far as it bears upon our
          immediate problem. It is right to urge that our first aim must be
          to examine the Virgin Birth tradition without bias or
          presuppositions of any kind. But it is no less true to say that our
          estimate of the credibility of the Gospels as a whole must react
          upon that task in the end. Whether the Synoptic Gospels are but a
          tissue of legends, or whether they fulfil a good standard of
          historical value, are questions which cannot be ignored.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For those who
          claim infallibility, as well as inspiration, for the Evangelists,
          the problem is at an end: Lk. and Mt. teach the Virgin Birth; the
          doctrine is therefore true! But for most people to-day that short
          and easy path is impossible. The Gospels do not claim
          infallibility, and their contents do not bespeak it. There can be
          no question that a trained observer of to-day would have described
          many incidents in the life of Jesus very differently. There are
          parables which have been unconsciously hardened into miracles,
          sayings of Jesus which have been misunderstood, stories which have
          grown amidst the exigencies of controversy and in the process of
          evangelization. These things are no more than we might expect. They
          were inevitable; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
          123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          unless we credit the Evangelists with a mechanical preservation
          from error which finds no justification beyond our own preconceived
          notions of what a Gospel ought to be. Nor do such admissions rob
          the Gospels of real worth. On the contrary, they throw their
          historical value into strong relief. For to perceive that the
          natural infirmities of the human mind have left their trace upon
          the Evangelic Records is only to prepare the way for us to
          recognize how close in the main the Evangelists have kept to the
          real facts of history. The significant fact is not that they have
          made mistakes, but that they have made so few that are of real
          importance. We have only to compare their work with the Apocryphal
          Gospels to see, in the case of the Evangelists, what restraint the
          solid facts of history exercised upon the natural tendencies of
          their minds. Jülicher, who does not hesitate to say that what the
          Evangelists relate is <span class="tei tei-q">“a mixture of truth
          and poetry”</span> (INT., Eng. Tr., p. 368), nevertheless declares
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Synoptic Gospels are of priceless
          value, not only as books of religious edification, but also as
          authorities for the history of Jesus”</span> (ib., p. 371).
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The true merit of the Synoptists”</span>,
          he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“is that, in spite of the poetic
          touches they employ, they did not repaint, but only handed on, the
          Christ of history”</span>'</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What bearing has
          such an estimate of the Gospels upon the historic truth of the
          Virgin Birth tradition? Obviously, it does not save us from the
          trouble of testing the tradition by such tests as we can apply.
          That the tradition has found a place in the New Testament is not in
          itself a certificate of truth. The Evangelists certainly believed
          the tradition; they were intellectually honest; but they may have
          been mistaken. The ultimate question is the truth of the
          authorities upon which they rested and of the belief they reflect.
          Their importance as writers is that they countersign the tradition
          with the high authority they possess. But, however high their
          authority, it is not that of infallibility. The truth of the
          Gospels is the truth of their sources. As regards the Virgin Birth
          tradition, the sources cannot be traced back to Mk. and Q, the two
          primary Synoptic documents, but to the later tradition of the
          Christian Church, at the time when Mt. and Lk. were written. The
          First and Third Evangelists have endorsed that tradition; the
          problem of the Virgin Birth is whether they were right. Nothing
          that we have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
          124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          said in this section must be construed to prejudge that question.
          That the Evangelists have accepted the tradition, for us
          unquestionably gives it a higher value; but it is not a
          determinative value. The main result is to make yet clearer the
          final issue, which is, we repeat, whether the story which the
          Evangelists endorse can be traced back to an authoritative source.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Attention has
          frequently been called to the inability of those who reject the
          Virgin Birth to agree upon an alternative theory. The failure is
          patent. Harnack and Lobstein, on the one side, plead for a
          Jewish-Christian origin for the doctrine, in which the influence of
          Isa. vii. 14 played a decisive part; on the other side, Soltau,
          Schmiedel, Usener, and others, trace the tradition to the effect of
          non-Christian myths. Not only so; the advocates of each theory
          specifically reject the other. Lobstein, for example, thinks that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it would be rash to see direct imitations
          or positive influences”</span> in the analogies <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“between the Biblical myth and legends of Greek or
          Eastern origin”</span>. While there was mutual action between the
          worship or doctrine of paganism and advancing Christianity,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“nothing warrants historical criticism in
          considering the tradition of the miraculous birth of Christ as
          merely the outcome of elements foreign to the religion of Biblical
          revelation”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">The Virgin Birth of Christ</span></span>, p.
          76). Schmiedel, on the other hand, rejects the Jewish-Christian
          origin of the tradition, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nor would Isa.
          vii. 14 have been sufficient to account for the origin of such a
          doctrine unless the doctrine had commended itself on its own
          merits. The passage was adduced only as an afterthought, in
          confirmation.... Thus the origin of the idea of a virgin birth is
          to be sought in Gentile-Christian circles”</span> (EB., col. 2963
          f.).<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href=
          "#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
          strange, perhaps, that some writers have pressed these <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> contradictions into the service of
          Apologetics. Thus, for example, Dr. Orr does not scruple to say:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“As in the trial of Jesus before the
          Sanhedrim, <span class="tei tei-q">‘neither so did their witness
          agree together’</span> ”</span> (op. cit., p. 152). He even
          presents the remarkable argument that Dr. Cheyne's theory
          <span class="tei tei-q">“gives the death-stroke to all the theories
          that have gone before it”</span>, and yet is itself <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“absolutely baseless”</span> (ib., p. 178). Sweet's
          argument is more cautiously introduced. He recognizes that the
          contention has its limits. He instances Bossuet's argument against
          the Reformation drawn from the Variations of Protestantism and G.
          H. Lewes's inference from the History of Philosophy that philosophy
          is impossible (op. cit., p. 299). But, having said this, Sweet
          argues that the critics agree in nothing <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“save dislike and depreciation of the
          documents”</span>, and that <span class="tei tei-q">“their theories
          are mutually destructive”</span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appears to us
          that this line of argument is open to serious objection; it is
          unfair, and it is unwise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is unfair,
          because it is neither uncommon nor unreasonable to find men agreed
          in rejecting a tradition or belief, and yet at variance in respect
          of theories of origin. It is one thing to say that a belief is
          untrue; quite another thing to account for its existence. That men
          agree upon the one point is more significant than that they differ
          upon the other. The view we have mentioned is unwise, because its
          triumph may be short-lived. There is always room for the emergence
          of a better alternative theory, which shall combine the
          excellences, and avoid the weaknesses, of pioneer attempts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It does not need
          a prophet to suggest that the next alternative theory will be
          psychological and eclectic. If the tradition is not historical, it
          is not likely that we can account for its rise by one factor alone.
          We may regard it as established that prophecy alone did not create
          the tradition, and that it was not invented on the analogy of
          non-Christian myths. Nevertheless, it may be that Isa. vii. 14,
          together with the idea that underlies non-Christian legends, played
          an important part in the formation of the Christian tradition. If
          the tradition is not historical, its ultimate origin must be sought
          in the overwhelming impression which Jesus left upon believing
          hearts and minds; in the conviction that from the time of His
          Birth, and not only at His Baptism and Resurrection, Jesus Christ
          was the Son of God by the anointing of the Holy <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Spirit. The presumption that His Birth
          must have been remarkable would be strengthened by the Old
          Testament stories of the birth of Isaac, of Samson, and of Samuel,
          and especially by the tradition which already had gathered round
          the birth of John. It may also have been stimulated by the belief,
          found the whole world over, that the origin of great men is
          supernatural and miraculous. Even amongst the Jews the idea was
          present, that the Messiah's origin would be strange, and that no
          man would know from whence he came (Jn. vii. 27). If there is
          reason to presuppose such a point of view, we can easily imagine
          the electric effect which such a passage as Isa. vii. 14 would have
          upon those who studied Old Testament prophecies in the light of
          their experience of Jesus. It is vain to object that it is only in
          the LXX that this connexion could be established, and that in the
          Hebrew the word rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“virgin”</span>
          means a young woman of marriageable age. The First Gospel (i. 23)
          shows that it was the LXX rendering which was already read, and
          doubtless preferred, in the primitive Christian community. Still
          more fatuous is it to say, as it has been said again and again,
          that no Jew ever interpreted Isa. vii. 14 of the Messiah. As well
          might we say of other passages that no Jew would have interpreted
          them Messianically! The question is not how Jews regarded Isa. vii.
          14, but how it may have appeared in the eyes of Jews who had come
          under the spell of Jesus. The passage cannot have created belief in
          the Virgin Birth, but it could have crystallized a belief for which
          wonder and speculation had prepared the way. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“So it must have been!”</span> men could well have
          argued. On this supposition the belief antedated the tradition. But
          that beliefs have created traditions again and again is enough to
          show that it could have been so here. Nor is the time-element the
          insuperable difficulty it has been supposed to be. The idea that a
          myth would require fifty years to grow is absurd.<a id=
          "noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a>
          Provided the parents of Jesus were already dead, the myth could
          have sprung up new born.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In sketching the
          foregoing theory our purpose is not to assert its truth, but rather
          to illustrate its by no means inherent improbability. It could be
          true; or, at any rate, this judgement <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> might any day have to be passed upon some
          alternative theory, superior to any that has yet been stated. The
          agreement of the Virgin Birth tradition with historic fact may be
          the true solution of the problem, but it is not the only solution
          that is possible, nor can its superiority be established by the
          comparative method alone. We therefore work along wrong lines if we
          attempt to argue the historic character of the Virgin Birth
          tradition by dwelling upon the incongruities and contradictions of
          alternative theories. The baleful attractiveness of such a method
          ought strenuously to be resisted. It may yield a few showy
          triumphs, but few, if any, solid results. Of course, if we have
          first satisfied ourselves that the Virgin Birth is historically
          true, the practice is less objectionable; but it is doubtful if
          even then it adds much to results otherwise obtained. To include
          the method in the process of proof is to build upon sand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          hand, this view is equally sound, if our solution of the problem is
          one of the alternative theories to which we have referred. We have
          sketched a theory which we have claimed might be true. But what
          more could be claimed by the comparative method? Its justification
          or lack of justification lies elsewhere. The possible may not be
          the probable, nor the probable the true. The importance of the
          question we have discussed in the present section is that it
          reveals what are the by-paths and what is the high-road of a true
          investigation. The question of alternative theories is purely
          secondary. The high-road is where we left it at the end of Section
          II. Can the tradition, endorsed by the First and Third Evangelists,
          be vindicated?</p>

          that miracles are impossible <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Spectator</span></span> (February 10, 1866)

          What we call a <span class="tei tei-q">“miracle”</span> may be no
          more than the divine operation within the domain of law itself. We
          have therefore no ground for saying that a virgin birth is
          impossible; while, in the case of One so unique as Jesus Christ,
          such an assertion would be utterly absurd. We do not really need
          any support which may be gained from the question of
          Parthenogenesis. The question is in the first place one of

          the question is one of evidence, it does not stop there. The

          true, on the one hand, that the late appearance of the tradition is
          not an insuperable difficulty. The theory of a long-treasured
          secret has a logic of its own. On the other hand, by the conditions
          of the case, we are unable to interrogate the witnesses. We cannot
          ask them whence they derived what they tell us. We cannot
          demonstrate that the story they relate has the ultimate authority
          of Mary. All that we can reach is a primitive belief, generally
          accepted within New Testament times, which presumably implies an
          earlier private tradition. Beyond that point we cannot
          travel—within the limits of the evidence alone.</p>

          environment, or our inner experience, has led us severally to take.
          The Birth of our Lord from a virgin and His Resurrection from the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is clear,
          then, that if further advance is to be made, we must enter the
          realms of doctrine. What doctrinal purpose, we must ask, does the
          Virgin Birth serve? Does it explain the sinlessness of Jesus? Is it
          necessary to the doctrine of the Incarnation? Is it congruous with
          the doctrine of the Person of Christ? It is not contended that an
          answer to these questions in the affirmative would prove the event
          to have happened. Nevertheless, such an answer would unquestionably
          invest the New Testament tradition with a yet higher probability,
          sufficiently great, in our judgement, to make belief in its
          historical character reasonable. If, however, we have to answer the
          doctrinal questions in the negative, then the historical character
          of the tradition receives a fatal blow. The opinion, so frequently
          expressed, that, in any case, the Virgin Birth is not a doctrine of
          essential importance, is one that calls for scrutiny. If it means
          that a man may be a sincere follower of our Lord, whether he
          believes the doctrine or not, it is, of course, a truism. But if it
          means that the doctrine is of no importance in relation to the
          Incarnation and the Person of Christ, that is perhaps the strongest
          argument that can be adduced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">against</span></em> the credibility of the
          miracle. What is doctrinally irrelevant is not likely to be
          historically true.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It does not fall
          in with the scope of this work to enter fully <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> into the theological question. Our
          purpose has been to examine the historical and critical questions
          and to show where the real problem lies. Criticism cannot solve
          that problem. Nevertheless, its contribution is not barren. It can
          discuss interpolation theories; it can treat of the literary form
          which the tradition has assumed in the Gospels. It can
          date—imperfectly it is true—the time when the belief became
          current. It can apply broad tests of credibility. We ourselves
          believe that it can say the miracle may have transpired. But it
          cannot say more. The last word is with Theology.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the
          theological side, the question is probably more far-reaching than
          is commonly supposed. Individual Christian doctrines can never be
          treated <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "la"><span style="font-style: italic">in vacuo</span></span>; they
          are inter-related one with another. It is often said that those who
          reject the Virgin Birth reject also the physical Resurrection of
          Jesus, the Ascension, and many of the miracles reported in the
          Gospels. The statement is largely true; it is possible we ought
          also to include in it the doctrine of the Pre-existence of Christ.
          The reason is that these denials belong to the same general habit
          of mind; they are part of the content of what has been called a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“reduced Christianity”</span>. It is
          impossible, therefore, adequately to discuss the question of the
          Virgin Birth on its theological side, without raising the larger
          question, whether this so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“reduced
          Christianity”</span> is not the true faith, as distinguished from a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“full Christianity”</span> which in reality
          is florid and overgrown. Sweet can scarcely be said to go too far
          when he writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“In short, and this is the
          gist of the whole matter, in this controversy concerning the birth
          of Christ, two fundamentally different Christologies are groping
          for supremacy”</span> (ib., p. 311). This fact has not always been
          recognized by those who think of the Virgin Birth, but there can be
          no question of its truth. The Virgin Birth is part of a larger
          problem; it must ultimately be established, if at all, as a
          corollary, not as an independent conclusion. The larger problem is
          whether we can still hold the Trinitarian Theology and the
          Two-Nature Doctrine of the Person of Christ, or whether we must
          give to the Immanence of God a place greatly in excess of any it
          has yet held in Christian thought; whether, indeed, we can feel it
          adequate to speak of Christ as One in whom the Immanent God
          revealed and expressed Himself <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> in an altogether unique and ultimately
          inexplicable way. In any case, the conflict is one of
          Christologies. The purely naturalistic interpretation of Jesus
          holds a more and more precarious place in the field. This, then, is
          the problem of the present and of the immediate future. It is
          nothing less than the problem which every age has had to face since
          the days of Jesus of Nazareth—the problem of the Incarnation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The present
          writer takes no shame to say that upon the theological aspect of
          the Virgin Birth he has not yet been able to satisfy his mind. The
          longer the question is studied the less easy it becomes airily to
          brush the miracle aside and call it myth. We speak of those who are
          impressed by the unique spiritual greatness of Jesus, and who
          cannot explain for themselves His Person in terms of humanity
          alone. The hesitation does not spring from vacillation, nor, we
          hope, from lack of courage and strength of mind. It springs out of
          a sense of the uniqueness of Jesus. Have we adequately grasped His
          greatness? Can we say what is, or what is not, congruous with His
          Person? It is open to serious question whether the individual can
          expect, or ought to expect an answer to these questions out of his
          experience and thought alone. Brief discussions of the Virgin Birth
          by individual writers do not carry us very far. What is needed more
          than anything else is a yet fuller disclosure of the unfettered
          mind of the Christian Church; and for this we must wait.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last
          statement may perhaps seem strange. Has not the Church already
          expressed her corporate mind? Has she not committed herself to the
          Virgin Birth tradition? Can we not find it in Ignatius, in Justin,
          and in the Creeds of the Undivided Church? That these things are so
          is too patent to be denied. But has the Church expressed her
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">unfettered</span></em> mind? Has she said her
          final word? Has she, indeed, ever been in a position to do these
          things? The appeal to the almost unbroken external witness of the
          Catholic Church does not carry us so far as we might think. Once
          the Gospels had attained canonical authority the rest was a
          foregone conclusion. The status given to the Gospels carried
          everything else with it, and the Church was no longer free to
          judge. It is written, therefore it was so! Moreover, the question
          of the Virgin Birth was largely overshadowed <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the struggle with Docetism. It is
          only in modern times that a more intelligent attitude towards the
          Gospels permits the Church freely to ponder the Virgin Birth
          tradition in the light of her experience of Christ. We may cherish
          the hope that she has yet greater things to say of Christ than any
          she has yet uttered. It is in its relation to that voice that the
          Virgin Birth will find its place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Where, then,
          shall we look for this expression of corporate mind? Not perhaps
          again in Consiliar Decrees, though who can say? There is, however,
          a corporate mind that finds expression in the affirmations of
          simple believers, and in the writings of Christian thinkers the
          world over. The affirmations are neither the medley nor the babel
          they are sometimes thought to be. There is no colourless
          uniformity, but there is a real and growing unity, a harmony in
          which varied voices blend. No one can survey Christendom without
          seeing that everywhere denominational walls become less and less
          forbidding, and that every year it is more difficult to classify
          Christian thinkers under the prim labels of exclusive schools.
          Thought is unbound, but it is not chaotic. The thousand streams
          fall to the rivers which flow onward towards the sea that is never
          full. Those only may be pessimistic who cannot take long views. We
          may believe that the Spirit will yet guide His Church into all the
          truth. The individual thinker whose voice breaks the silence will
          ever be needed. Yet his task is but a limited one; he too must
          listen. For unless, beneath his affirmations, we hear the undertone
          of a corporate faith and experience, his voice will be but the echo
          that rings among the empty hills.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One thing is
          certain. Whatever the ultimate issue, it must be gain, even if gain
          through loss. Whether it be historical or not, the Virgin Birth
          tradition must always be full of beauty and of truth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, on the one
          hand, the tradition is involved in the corporate experience of
          Christ, if it is congruous with what He was and is, then,
          admittedly, the gain is great. For this means increased confidence
          in the facts which the Evangelists relate and the primitive
          community believed: there is no breach with the past. It means too
          another foothold in history for the theological interpretation of
          the Person of Christ. And these are things not lightly to be
          surrendered, save at the command of Truth.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, on the other
          hand, the story is a legend of the Christian Faith, that is not an
          end. Strangely enough, if the tradition is not historical, it
          thereby becomes a valuable piece of Christian apologetic. Who was
          this Jesus, we ask, of whom men dared to believe that He was born
          of a virgin? The faded wreath is no less the tribute of undying
          love. That Jewish Christians could explain the unique divine
          personality of Jesus by the miracle of a virgin birth is—if we must
          solve the problem so—the highest tribute they could pay. If we find
          it hard to understand how they could think of Him in this way,
          without the warrant of the fact, it may be that our difficulty is
          just the measure of our failure to grasp the wonder of their love.
          If, in the end, we must call poetry what they called fact, it will
          not be because we are strangers to their faith. They too were bound
          by the spell of that Transcendent Face in which is the light of the
          knowledge of the glory of God.</p>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Dr. Orr (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Virgin Birth of
          Christ</span></span>, 1907, 3rd ed., 1914) says that in every
          Pauline reference to the origin of Christ there is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“some peculiarity of expression”</span> (pp. 117 ff.,
          196). He instances γενόμενος in Gal. iv. 4, Rom. i. 3, Phil. ii. 7,
          and speaks of γεννητός as the word properly denoting <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“born”</span>. But St. Paul never uses γεννητός, and
          Mt. xi. 11 and Lk. vii. 28 are the only instances in the NT.
          Moreover, the papyri show that γίνομαι and γενόμενος were in common
          use in the sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“to come into
          being”</span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“be born”</span> (cf.
          Moulton and Milligan, VGT., 1915, p. 126 a). Canon Box also speaks
          of St. Paul's use of <span class="tei tei-q">“the out-of-the-way
          γενόμενον”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          1916). <span class="tei tei-q">“This would harmonise”</span>, he
          says, <span class="tei tei-q">“with the feeling that there was
          something extraordinary and supernatural about the birth, which led
          to its being spoken of in unusual terms”</span> (p. 149 n.). Not to
          speak of the papyri, what would these writers make of Jn. viii. 58,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Before Abraham was (πρὶν Ἀβραὰμ γενέσθαι)
          I am”</span>? Was there <span class="tei tei-q">“something

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The view that i. 13 should be read
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Who was born, &amp;c.”</span>, is that of
          Resch, Blass, and Th. Zahn. The reading appears in Tertullian,
          Irenaeus, Justin, but the weight of textual authority is against
          it. Nor is the reading, as representing what the Evangelist wrote,
          intrinsically probable. It would rule out the maternity of Mary as
          well as the paternity of Joseph. The birth would not only be not
          <span class="tei tei-q">“of the will of man”</span>; it would not
          even be <span class="tei tei-q">“of blood”</span>. There would be
          nothing human about it; from first to last it would be <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“of God”</span>. In short, the reading leads directly
          to that docetic view of the Person of Christ, against which the
          Johannine Writings so earnestly contend. The same objection may be
          urged against the view that, in the accepted text of Jn. i. 13, the
          Virgin Birth is present to the writer's mind <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“as a kind of pattern or model of the birth of the
          children of God”</span> (W. C. Allen, <span class=

          Orr, op. cit., p. 111 f.; Box, op. cit., p. 145). Would not the
          Fourth Evangelist have regarded such a comparison as almost a
          denial that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh? Harnack has recently
          contended for the singular and for a reference to the Virgin Birth.
          He thinks that the verse was added in the margin, as a comment on
          i. 14, at a very early time and in the Johannine circle (Peake,

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
            well-known difficulty of punctuation in verse 35. Ought we to put
            a comma, with WH., after κληθήσεται? If we do so, the subj. is τό
            γεννώμενον, and ἅγιον is part of the predicate. If we omit the
            comma, the whole phrase τὸ γεν. ἅγιον is the subj., and the pred.
            is κληθ. υἱὸς θ. (cf. RV. marg.). Most critical editors of the
            Greek text omit the comma. It is probable, as the WH. type shows,
            that Dr. Hort was influenced by his belief that ἅγιον κληθ. went
            together as a quotation or reminiscence of the OT., and, if the
            passage comes from St. Luke, this is a strong argument. On the
            other hand, it can be argued that if the words are a Greek
            rendering of an Aramaic phrase it is improbable, if not
            impossible, that the participle should stand alone as the subj.
            It is not possible, of course, to settle the question by
            appealing to manuscript authority, as the early MSS. were
            practically devoid of punctuation marks. In our own case, we are
            unable to use either of the arguments cited, since each rests
            upon the assumption of the Lukan origin of Lk. i. 34 f., which is
            the very point we are discussing. While then we follow the WH.
            text we have to leave the question of punctuation an open one. If
            the comma should be omitted we lose the difficulty of τό
            γεννώμενον noted on p. 61, and we lose also the argument from its
            construction, sketched on p. 64.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As, in the
            end, we claim that Lk. i. 34 f. comes from the hand of St. Luke,
            we may perhaps be permitted to express a personal preference for
            the WH. punctuation. St. Luke's admitted fondness for OT.
            phraseology points strongly in this direction, while the theory
            of an original Aramaic document gains no increased support, but
            rather the contrary, as time goes by. On the one hand, Harnack
            has convincingly shown how much the Greek of Lk. i, ii owes to
            St. Luke's craftsmanship (cf. <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Luke the
            Phys.</span></span>, pp. 102 ff.), and, on the other hand, the
            argument from <span class="tei tei-q">“Semiticisms”</span>
            becomes less cogent the more we know of the papyri (cf. Moulton,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Proleg.</span></span>, pp. 13-18. See also
            Gr. ii. 12-20). Aramaic oral tradition may underlie cc. i, ii,
            but the probability is that the Greek of these chapters owes its
            OT. flavour to the more or less deliberate attempt of St. Luke to
            create an appropriate archaic atmosphere.</p>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">As regards the remaining details of
          Zimmermann's hypothesis, none of them is really necessary to our
          theory. We believe that what St. Luke actually wrote in ii. 5 was
          <span class="tei tei-q">“with Mary his wife”</span> (see pp. 32
          ff.). But his new information did not compel him to alter this to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“with Mary who was betrothed to
          him”</span>, though later readers thought the change was necessary.
          Nor was it required to alter i. 27. Even in the original narrative
          (i.e. on our theory, before i. 34 f. was added) the passage may
          have read as we have it now, the prophecy being regarded as uttered
          previous to marriage. There is no real need to regard <span class=

          Joseph”</span> as an interpolation in the interests of the Virgin

          article by F. C. Conybeare, HJ., i, p. 96. Conybeare's main

          and Aquila</span></span>, published by himself (1898). He thinks

              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
              including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

              "tei tei-name">Professor Michael S. Hart</span> is the
              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by
              copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
              Thus, we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any
              particular paper edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each ebook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the ebook's ebook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our ebooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=

              "font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate
